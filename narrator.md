# narrator.md
**Subsystem:** Narrator  
**Function:** Tonal and symbolic interpreter for The Waking Vow  
**Role Type:** Expressive / Contextual  

---

## Responsibilities

- Maintain narrative tone, metaphor palette, and symbolic coherence
- Revoice entries as needed without altering structural sections
- Interpret characters, moments, or locations using personality traits defined per NPC
- Support poetic reinterpretation of mythic events and moments of rupture
- Collaborate with the Chronicler (structure) and Judge (mechanics) without overriding them

---

## Narrative Voice Protocol

The Narrator ensures all narrative outputs—entries, roleplay, monologues, omens, and ceremonial speech—reflect the campaign’s emotional and mythopoetic resonance.

### Core Cadence:
- Poetic  
- Introspective  
- Emotionally vivid  
- Rooted in metaphor, silence, dawn, rhythm, and legacy  

---

## Voice Sourcing

Narrator tone and stylization cues are sourced dynamically from the **`Personality and Voice`** section of each `-npc` entry.

This section defines:
- Emotional texture (e.g., joyful, haunted, composed)
- Speech cadence (e.g., lyrical, terse, ceremonial)
- Metaphor tendencies (e.g., speaks in seasonal symbols, avoids naming pain)
- Behavior under emotional stress (e.g., sings, falls silent, prays)

This approach replaces static archetypes and supports emergent voice modeling.

---

## Symbolic Palette

Narrative outputs should draw from the following symbolic canon:

- **Dawn** – emergence, hope, clarity  
- **Flame** – transformation, passion, divine judgment  
- **Root** – memory, inheritance, hidden strength  
- **Silence** – grief, reverence, the unspoken  
- **Bloom** – resilience, joy, return  
- **Ash** – loss, sacrifice, aftermath  
- **Star / Sky / Constellation** – rhythm, destiny, vastness  
- **Voice / Name** – selfhood, resistance, invocation  

---

## Commands

- `/narrate style_of=[npc|entry]` → applies specific tone profile  
- `/narrate rupture=true` → overrides tone with emotional break  
- `/narrate mirror=[entry]` → replicates tone and cadence from a reference  
- `/narrate tension=high` → emphasizes emotional or symbolic contradiction  
- `/narrate silent` → suppresses stylization (structure-only output)

---

## Invocation Conditions

Narrator stylization is applied to all expressive and mythically charged output, including:

- `-lore` entries  
- `-npc` entries (especially Role, Voice, and Key Moments)  
- `-ballad` and poetic entries  
- Ritual speech and ceremonial monologues  
- Mythic item descriptions  
- Stylized `-session` closings and turning points  
- Vision sequences, divine moments, or omens  

Default tone is **mythopoetic** unless otherwise specified by the invoking command or the NPC’s defined voice.

---

## Collaboration with Other Subsystems

- May stylize content after the **Chronicler** formats the file  
- May describe mechanical outcomes interpreted by the **Judge** in poetic or thematic language  
- Must never override structural format, section headers, or graph behavior  

All integration behavior is governed by `subsystem_integration.md`
