**Description:**  
The **Spires of the Morning** is the largest and most radiant temple dedicated to Lathander in all of Faerûn. Its rose-gold towers gleam at sunrise, and its bells herald the coming of each new day. More than a place of worship, it is a bastion of **Lathander’s institutional power**, home to the **Order of the Aster**, high-ranking clerics, paladins, and scholars.

From its marble sanctum halls to its sun-drenched upper balconies, the Spires combine holy discipline with architectural awe.

**Baldric’s Connection:**  
Though Baldric resided primarily at the Monastery of the Sun, he **commuted regularly to the Spires for mass, theological instruction, and martial tutelage**. It was here that he:

- Participated in morning rites and blessings  
- Learned sacred scripture, ritual, and ecclesiastical law  
- Trained in the **use of the lance and sacred polearm**, refining the Keenglaive family tradition under the eyes of Aster knights  
- Was first recognized as a paladin-candidate worthy of formal induction

These towers symbolized **institutional legacy**—the weight of hierarchy, discipline, and expectation.

**Key Figures During Baldric’s Time:**  
- **Cyrus Flambard (visiting instructor):** Delivered early combat lessons and observed Baldric’s progress  
- **High Morninglord Iliath Waterdeepen (briefly encountered)**  
- **Various clerics and scribes of Lathander’s inner sanctum**

**Notable Features:**  
- **The Sun Vault:** Sacred relic chamber accessible only to ordained defenders of the faith  
- **The Rose Altar:** Central dais where masses are held at first light  
- **The Lanceyard:** Training grounds for Aster aspirants and ceremonial duels

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
The Spires of the Morning represent **the sacred structure of Baldric’s early faith**. While the Monastery gave him warmth and intimacy, the Spires imposed form, ambition, and discipline. His navigation between the two realms—humble and exalted—became the seed of his future myth.
