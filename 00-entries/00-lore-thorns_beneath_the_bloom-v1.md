**Name:** Thorns Beneath the Bloom  
**Theme:** Heresy, strategy, spiritual restraint  
**Timeframe:** Spring of 1366 DR

---

**Origin:**  
In **Trailsend**, a preacher drew crowds not by prophecy—but by healing.

He laid hands on the wounded. He calmed the mad. He fed the hungry. And when asked from whence his miracles came, he said only:

> *“The Yellow Sun rises soon. When it does, all names will burn away.”*

To the people, he was **a saint without a shrine**.  
To Flambard, he was **a spark that needed extinguishing**.

---

**Expression in the World:**  
Flambard gave the order—quietly, but with conviction: **“Silence him. End this.”**

But Baldric hesitated.

He recognized the doctrine. **Elversult. Orndeir. The Risen Sun Heresy.**  
This was not a madman—it was **a vanguard**.

Baldric did not draw his blade. He watched. He listened.  
And then he went to his father, **Wycbuhr**, not for orders—but for permission to act as Warden.

Together, they issued a civic decree:
- The town infirmary would be expanded.  
- Healers from the Order of the Aster would be stationed long-term.  
- The preacher, thanked publicly, was invited to depart.  
- No mention of heresy was spoken aloud.

---

**Outcome & Legacy:**  
The preacher vanished within days. No riot came.  
But the people remembered the cures more than the creed.

Baldric did not destroy the doctrine—he **defused its foothold**.

And though the bloom of the barony grew stronger under his gaze, he could not help but sense that **something still lingered beneath the roots**.
