**Name:** Thoradin Anvilsong  
**Race:** Shield Dwarf  
**Class:** Forge-Cleric / Runesmith  
**Affiliation:** Mithral Halls, Clan Battlehammer  
**Title:** Forge-Soul of the Inner Temple

**Description:**  
Thoradin Anvilsong is a dwarven master-smith, spiritual artisan, and keeper of sacred forges beneath the heart of Mithral Halls. Known more for his intuition than his speech, he is regarded as a **dream-haunted craftsman**, whose hands are moved as much by memory as by fire.

A devout follower of Moradin, Thoradin sees craftsmanship not only as utility, but as **prophecy given shape**. His works are rare, his voice measured, and his eyes always watch for the unseen pattern beneath events.

**Role in Baldric’s Story:**  
Thoradin first met Baldric in the moment of near-death—torn from a bridge during a tremor and caught midfall by the young paladin’s radiant wings.

The moment changed him. In the glow and rush of that fall, he heard what he later called a **divine chord**—a sound that stirred not panic, but purpose.

Later, in gratitude and revelation, Thoradin forged the **Dawn Aegis**, embedding within it a scroll-tube containing schematics for a future relic: **Coronatta**. He believed the armor to be not a gift, but a **mirror**—showing Baldric the truth of who he was becoming.

**Personality and Voice:**  
- Speaks few words; each carries weight  
- Believes **memory, music, and metal** are divine languages  
- Honors faith, but trusts inspiration more than doctrine

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Thoradin is not a follower of Baldric, but a **recognizer**—one who witnesses and answers. His craftsmanship did not empower Baldric, but **responded to him**, weaving the boy’s courage into a form others could see.

His name is sung quietly in halls where forge-prayers are offered. In myth, he is remembered as the one who **saw the story forming and dared to shape it**.
