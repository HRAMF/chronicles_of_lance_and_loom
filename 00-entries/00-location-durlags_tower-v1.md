**Name:** Durlag’s Tower  
**Region:** The Sword Coast, east of Baldur’s Gate, near the Cloud Peaks  
**Affiliation:** None; considered cursed and unclaimed  
**Known For:** Deadly traps, hauntings, spiritual echoes, trials of identity and memory

---

**Description:**  
Durlag’s Tower is less a fortress and more a mausoleum built by obsession. It was raised stone by stone by **Durlag Trollkiller**, a dwarven hero who survived betrayal and loss only to spiral into paranoia. He constructed the tower not to guard the world—but to guard himself.

Since his death, the tower has become a pilgrimage for those who seek to test their courage, cunning, and conviction. But even centuries later, **the spirits return nightly**, undeterred by exorcisms or clerical rites.

**Historical Role:**  
Once a personal keep, Durlag’s Tower grew into a symbol of tragic legacy. Its halls are infamous among adventuring circles, not just for traps and monsters, but for **spiritual mazes**—echoes of Durlag’s life re-enacted in illusion and spectral repetition.

Clerics have failed to grant peace to the tower’s residents. Even **Lathanderite priests** now treat it as a locus of spiritual rupture rather than haunt alone.

**Events or Encounters (Baldric’s Chronicle):**  
- Baldric did not enter alone, nor recklessly. He secured **Flambard’s approval** and assembled a capable retinue.  
- His priority: **identify the cause of the hauntings** and **release the imprisoned souls** if possible.  
- At the base of the deepest descent, he encounters the **specter of a fallen Lathanderite knight**—unnamed in song, but still bearing a radiant seal.  
- The knight’s final act before death was to conceal his relic beneath the Tower’s altar, fearing corruption.  
- In releasing the knight’s soul, Baldric **awakens the relic**—a radiant lance once known only by its symbol.

**Spiritual Significance:**  
Durlag’s Tower tests not the body, but **the self**. To pass is not to slay—but to **remain oneself in the face of inherited sorrow**.  
For Baldric, the tower did not offer glory—it offered a **mirror**. In cleansing it, he inherited not just a weapon—but a burden shaped like purpose.
