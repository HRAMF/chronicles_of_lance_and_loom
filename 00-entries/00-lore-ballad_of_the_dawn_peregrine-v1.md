**Name:** Ballad of the Dawn Peregrine  
**Theme:** Witnessing legend, birth of a song  
**Timeframe:** Summer, 1365 DR

---

**Origin:**  
Priscilla Callonetta was hired as a bard to accompany a troop of knights during a ceremonial ogre hunt outside Yartar. Her role was to compose a song worthy of their anticipated valor.

The hunt began in silence, uneventful, a parade of bored anticipation. But in the small hours before dawn, it became tragedy. The knights were ambushed. Slaughtered. Priscilla ran, fleeing into the dark woods, three ogres on her trail.

**Expression in the World:**  
And then—he came.

A blazing silhouette descended in radiant wings and orange-gold light. A knight without trumpet, riding no banner but **the dawn itself**. His weapon—glaive of flame and precision—moved with divine clarity. Three strikes. Three heads fell. Then six more in the camp beyond.

Priscilla watched from afar as **the falcon-shaped light** moved among the ogres, not as a man, but as a myth taking form. When he returned, he cradled her wound, spoke gently, and bore her away on his pale steed, wings folded in grace.

She did not weep. She **wrote**.

**Outcome & Legacy:**  
From that encounter came her first true composition:  
> *“The Ballad of the Dawn Peregrine.”*  
It became a staple in taverns from Yartar to Baldur’s Gate. And though few knew its subject, fewer still forgot its refrain.

It was this moment—not the wedding, not the war—that first **braided their destinies**. He saved her life. She preserved his soul.
