*Type: npc-entry*

**Name:** Priscilla “Callonetta”  
**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Bard (College of Lore)  
**Alignment:** Chaotic Good  
**Status:** Myth-Echo Survivor, Partially Rewoven  
**Affiliations:** Chronicler of the Blooming Vow, Witness to the Trials of the Mirrorborn

---

**Update Summary:**  
After being partially ensnared in a mythic falsehood beneath Herondale, Priscilla was rescued by Baldric and Calanthe through the completion of the Trials of the Mirrorborn. Her essence had been split—one fragment still aware, the other performing a myth-echo role shaped by false legend. Upon her restoration, she retains the memories of both versions: the real, and the nearly rewritten.

---

**Changed Traits:**  
- **Trait (evolved):** Occasionally speaks in second person when overwhelmed, as if narrating her own actions  
- **Ideal (reinforced):** Stories do not belong to those who tell them, but to those who survive them  
- **Bond (deepened):** Has developed a profound, if quiet, reverence for Calanthe’s clarity and Baldric’s restraint  
- **Flaw (new):** Harbors fear of being overwritten again—watches mirrors too long  

---

**Narrative Role (Expanded):**  
Priscilla is no longer just a chronicler—she is a living example of what happens when myth takes hold of memory. Her experience lends her unique sensitivity to echo-touched places, and her voice may now act as a counter-rhythm to invasive myth. She has begun composing a ballad she hasn’t yet shared with anyone, titled *“The Mirror Lied First.”*

---

**Known Abilities (Updated):**  
- **Mythic Resonance:** Priscilla can now detect weak myth-echoes within 30 ft. once per day (flavored Lore/Arcana check)  
- **Echo Counter-Song:** Can expend a Bardic Inspiration to grant an ally advantage on a save vs charm/illusion or myth effects  
- **Rewoven Voice:** Once per long rest, may restore a memory or name to an echo-struck NPC via *Calm Emotions* + *Prestidigitation* narrative effect

- Session 04 (rescue and reconstitution)
