**Name:** Starbound Resonance  
**Theme:** Divine Soul Sorcery, Cosmic Harmony, Lathanderite Revelation

---

**Origin:**  
*Starbound Resonance* is the term coined by **Arran Brightsmile** of **Rhyester’s Matins** to describe a rare alignment in which divine energy does not descend into a soul through invocation—but rises from within it as harmonic echo.

It is a phenomenon most often observed in aasimar and vision-touched beings whose hearts are already attuned to celestial order. Rather than needing symbols or sermons, these individuals shape magic as one would shape breath or music: intuitively, beautifully, and in alignment with divine will.

**Expression in the World:**  
- Considered both a blessing and a burden, Starbound Resonance carries emotional weight—grief, joy, conviction—all become vessels for light.  
- Practitioners are often misunderstood by strict clergy, but revered among druids, bards, and visionary priests.  
- Rites that nurture this resonance involve **echo meditation**, **mirror chanting**, and **stellar breath cycles**—all taught by Arran.

**Impact on Baldric Keenglaive:**  
This understanding was pivotal. Where others tried to categorize or contain Baldric’s divine gifts, **Arran Brightsmile** welcomed them like a constellation unfolding.

She taught Baldric to trust his instincts, feel the emotion beneath the magic, and let sorrow, love, and memory become spell forms. His sanctification of a broken altar during this period was not an act of ritual—it was an act of **remembrance and resonance**.

Where the Oath tried to discipline his soul, the stars taught him to **trust its song**.
