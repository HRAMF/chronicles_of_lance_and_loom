**Role in Narrative:**  
Nemphre was once Arkion’s lover, research partner, and fellow apprentice under a professor now long forgotten. After their separation, she withdrew from public life, dedicating herself to illusions—**not for deception, but remembrance**.

Ulcaster suspects her of defiling his ruins. She possesses a **ring once belonging to Arkion**, recovered from the debris. Like him, she claims it was out of sentiment… not magic.

But her eyes say otherwise.

**Personality and Voice:**  
- Serene, dignified, but rarely reveals more than surface calm  
- Speaks with precision, as if language itself could bind sorrow  
- Keeps a tower of mirrored halls, where visitors see only themselves until invited deeper  
- When pressed, her voice sharpens—not with rage, but with the tremor of unresolved mourning

---

**Key Moments with Baldric:**  
- Receives Baldric in silence. Offers tea. Refuses to discuss Arkion until pressed with kindness, not law.  
- Admits
