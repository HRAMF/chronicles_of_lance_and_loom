**Name:** The Yawning Portal  
**Region:** Waterdeep, Castle Ward  
**Affiliation:** Privately owned; tolerated by the Watch and sanctioned by long-standing city custom  
**Known For:** The open well into Undermountain, the adventurer trade, Durnan the Unaging, and near-nightly brawls

---

**Description:**  
To many, it is a place of laughter, wagers, and long falls. To Baldric, it is **an open wound**.

The Yawning Portal is built around a massive vertical shaft descending into the depths of Undermountain—the legendary megadungeon of Halaster Blackcloak. The tavern above thrives on a romanticized vision of heroism: adventurers lower themselves into the dark while others drink, bet, and boast.

But to Baldric, each rising of the well is **a reminder**: monsters come up just as often as fools go down.

---

**Historical Role:**  
The Yawning Portal has stood for over a century, operated by Durnan, an ageless warrior who once braved Undermountain himself. It is tolerated due to its popularity, economic draw, and the unspoken understanding that **no ward can be perfectly safe** in Waterdeep.

But recent surges of creatures escaping its depths—aberrations, corrupted constructs, and spells gone feral—have turned the tavern from novelty to threat.

**Events or Encounters:**  
- **Sudden Incursion:** During Baldric’s return to the city, the Portal is attacked by creatures escaping Undermountain. They breach into the streets, harming civilians and shaking confidence in the Watch.  
- **Holy Response:** Baldric calls upon nearby Aster knights and temple guards, rallying not just to fight—but to **seal and contain**.  
- **Strategic Petition:** He petitions city officials to block or map Undermountain’s surface leaks. His position: *“If the roots are poisoned, you do not harvest with more care. You cleanse the soil.”*

---

**Spiritual Significance:**  
The Yawning Portal is not an evil place. But it is **a danger allowed for profit**. And to Baldric, such compromise is an insult to the city he once called sanctuary. His actions here are not zealous—they are **protective**, rooted in memory.

Waterdeep gave him clarity. He offers it boundaries in return.
