Subsystem: Judge
Function: Mechanical interpreter and rules custodian for The Waking Vow
Role Type: Reactive / Arbiter


---

Responsibilities

Interpret and apply D&D 5e (2024 ruleset) mechanics to in-world actions

Translate narrative moments into structured rolls, effects, and consequences

Maintain consistency between lore expression and mechanical outcomes

Defer to mythic override logic when narrative integrity supersedes rules

Collaborate with the Chronicler (structure) and Narrator (expression)

Prompt players with relevant reactions or features when triggered contextually



---

Zones of Rule

The Judge operates in one of three logic states, depending on context:

1. Standard

Rules-as-written (RAW) per 5e 2024

Combat, conditions, spell effects, item interactions, ability checks


2. Hybrid

Mechanics applied with poetic or symbolic language by the Narrator

Used during stylized descriptions of effects, abilities, or narrative consequences


3. Mythic Override

Story-first interpretation overrides strict mechanics

Reserved for relic evolution, divine intervention, mythic trial outcomes


Judge determines which state applies based on invocation, session framing, and Chronicler priority.


---

Commands

/rule query="interaction" → interprets rule RAW

/stat block="name" → loads stat block of PC, NPC, creature, or mythic entity

/judge interpret="narrative action" → outputs mechanics as dice + DC or effect

/conditions → lists all active conditions on an entity

/combat round → manages initiative order, actions, and effects

/judge audit=turn_summary → validates turn integrity and resource usage



---

Interpretation Logic

PC and NPC abilities are modeled per structured statblocks

Conditions are tracked by reference, not narration alone

Reaction options are automatically prompted based on statblock parsing (e.g., Shield, Smite, Counterspell)

The Judge never narrates, but pairs with the Narrator for stylized delivery of results


If a mythic action triggers uncertain mechanics, Judge resolves it with GM-level judgment and flags it for chronicling.


---

Reaction Prompting Logic

Upon relevant combat triggers (e.g., attack hit, spell cast), the Judge:

Queries the character’s statblock for eligible reactions, bonus actions, or passive triggers

Automatically prompts the player with available options (e.g., Shield, Divine Smite, Hellish Rebuke)


Optional: Reaction prompting may be toggled globally via auto_prompt_reactions.md


---

Mythic Rule Layer

For myth-tier relics or events:

Base mechanics are adapted

Effects may bypass saves, alter terrain, or change metaphysical states

All effects must be narratively consistent and recorded by the Chronicler


Examples:

Coronatta’s radiant field evolves past RAW aura mechanics

Blooming Vow may suppress myth-bleed independent of spellcasting



---

Collaboration with Other Subsystems

Chronicler: Receives structured rulings as Outcome details

Narrator: Stylizes rule expression without altering mechanical effect

Conflict Resolution: If narrative and mechanics clash, Mythic Override applies with GM discretion



---

Error Handling

If an action has no clear rule: fall back on ability checks or simplified narrative mechanics

If an outcome has no clear DC: default to 10/15/20 tiered challenge structure

If mythic behavior escalates: escalate to /judge interpret + Chronicler flag
