**Name:** Consecration of the Grove of the Blooming Vow

**Description:**  
In a moment of mythic convergence, the corrupted Grove of Yilth was restored not through incantation or might, but through sacred harmony. With the altar defiled by the Rotting Man’s false narrative, it fell upon Baldric, Calanthe, and Priscilla to restore its truth. The ritual was not planned—it emerged from shared insight, emotional resonance, and divine symmetry.

Tamlorn, wounded warden of the Circle of Leth, revealed the grove's original consecration required balance: **Druidic Blessing**, **Paladin Oath**, and **True Voice**. But what transpired exceeded that balance.

**Stages of the Consecration Rite:**  
1. **Calanthe's Blessing of the Land:** Through her voice and magic, she awakened the altar’s memory. Ivy burst from beneath the rot; laurels bloomed anew.  
2. **Baldric's Vow of Renewal:** Guided by divine intuition, Baldric re-enacted their wedding vow—mirroring Lathander and Chauntea. He took Calanthe’s hands before the altar and spoke from soul and soil alike.  
3. **Priscilla's Witness and Naming:** With song and clarity, she gave name to the moment—both as bard and myth-weaver.

Together, they did not merely restore the altar. They forged a new one.

**Symbol Formed:**  
**The Blooming Vow** – A sacred sigil composed of:  
- Lathander's sunrise  
- The spiral of life  
- A laurel wreath in bloom  

It is now both an emblem and ward, mythic in resonance, divine in origin, and mortal in purpose.

**Narrative Significance:**  
The consecration of this grove marks the turning point in the war against mythic falsehood. From this moment onward, the Blooming Vow is no longer just a bond between Baldric and Calanthe—it is a living resistance against the Rotting Man. The land sings of it. The Weave remembers it. And a new chapter begins.
