Session 05 – Return to Dun-Tharos
 Campaign Title: The Waking Vow: Chronicles of the Blooming Dawn

Date of Session: Mid Spring, 1372 DR
 Setting: From Ironspur to the southern edges of Dun-Tharos

Summary:
 Following their harrowing victory in the mirror-echo realm and the rescue of Priscilla, Baldric and Calanthe return to Ironspur. There, tensions simmer—the Order of the Aster is fractured, and Flambard struggles to hold together its fading command.
Before council is called, the duo encounters Tamlorn, a druid of the Circle of Leth, who survived a confrontation with the corrupted echoes now festering across the Rawlinswood. Scarred and changed, Tamlorn speaks of a festering presence that twists memory and oath alike.
Shortly after, the Ironspur War Council is held. Word from Heliogabalus is clear: King Gareth Dragonsbane grants full operational authority to Baldric Keenglaive over the Order's southern front. Command falls to him—and with it, the responsibility to shape the strategy in this mythic war.
With Flambard’s aid, Baldric enacts a multi-layered plan: entrenched defense of sanctified groves, a strike team to purge corrupted sites and echoes, and a roving scout rotation to maintain lines between sites. The burden of command is accepted with clarity.
With no time to waste, Calanthe opens a path through the Weave using Tree Stride, transporting the group swiftly to the corrupted threshold of Dun-Tharos.
There, they find a grove consumed in falsehood, and a mirror-faced figure—a cruel parody of Baldric—leading a band of corrupted druids. A fierce battle erupts. Baldric, Calanthe, Priscilla, and Tamlorn fight side by side, blending radiant wrath and natural retribution.
The echo is slain. The grove lies broken and weeping.
And then, a ritual begins—not scripted, but sacred. Baldric and Calanthe renew their vows, not for spectacle, but for truth. Their love, grounded in the mortal and the mythic, summons something deeper.
From the ruined altar, the land itself responds. A golden sigil blossoms unbidden—the Blooming Vow, a radiant weaving of root and ray. And beneath the altar, as Baldric kneels in reverence, he finds a gift long-buried: the Dawnsteel Root, glowing with divine resonance.
