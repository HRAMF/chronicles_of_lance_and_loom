Dawnsteel Root â€“ Blooming Vow Strain
Rare Crafting Component (Coronatta Core)
 Origin: Grove of the Blooming Vow
Description:
 This radiant root of naturally-formed Dawnsteel emerged from the soil during the reconsecration of the Grove. Forged not by mortal hands but by the harmony of divine love and druidic balance, it pulses with warmth and breathes with a slow, radiant rhythm.
Properties:
May serve as the heart or core channel of a mythic weapon.
Functions as a light-aligned radiant conductor, attuned to sacred vows and mythic renewal.
When forged into a weapon, it could:
Enhance radiant damage or divine channeling.
Amplify effects triggered by love, oaths, or healing.
Cannot be replicated or replaced. If destroyed, the altar must be reconsecrated anew.
