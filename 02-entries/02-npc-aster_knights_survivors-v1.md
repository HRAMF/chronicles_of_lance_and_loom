**Group Name:** Ironspur Aster Survivors

**Location:** Ironspur Outpost  
**Current Status:** Diminished; recovering from recent arcane assault  
**Commanding Officer:** Sir Cyrus Flambard

**Description:**  
Once a full garrison, the Ironspur chapter of the Order of the Aster now numbers only a few battered but determined knights. Survivors of an arcane siege that left parts of the fortress scorched and half-ruined, they maintain their posts with steadfast devotion. Their morale is tested, but their oath remains unbroken.

**Known Members (Individual Names TBD):**  
- A knight with a frost-scarred helm who bears witness to myth-echoed illusions at night  
- A former healer turned scout after their apothecary was destroyed  
- A mute lance-bearer whose voice was lost during the collapse of the chapel dome

---

**Personality & Group Profile:**  
- **Trait:** Speak little, but watch everything  
- **Ideal:** “We are the light that survives even after the sun sets.”  
- **Bond:** Bound to each other and Flambard by shared loss  
- **Flaw:** Many bear survivor’s guilt and are reluctant to leave the outpost

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
These knights represent the lingering strength of the old order—diminished, but not extinguished. Their testimony provides Baldric and Calanthe with key insight into the physical manifestation of mythic corruption in Damara. They are also a symbol of what’s at stake: duty, faith, and the need for rebirth.
