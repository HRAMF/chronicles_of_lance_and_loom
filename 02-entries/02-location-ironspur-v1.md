**Name:** Ironspur

**Description:**  
Ironspur is a small but fortified outpost nestled at the edge of the highlands above the Merchant's Run. Built to guard the trade corridor and serve as a northern watchtower against Vaasani incursions, it now bears the scars of recent mythic conflict. Its stone battlements and Aster chapel have both suffered, with scorched walls and collapsed sections still under repair.

Though once a proud staging point for dawnward campaigns, the stronghold now houses only a fraction of its garrison. Its beacon has not been lit in weeks, and rumors swirl among the remaining knights of vanished patrols and eerie night songs drifting from the east.

**Notable Features:**  
- **The Dawnfire Beacon:** Currently dormant, designed to signal Helgabal in times of crisis  
- **Aster Chapel:** Damaged by mythic backlash, its altar bears fading consecration  
- **Strategic Walltop View:** Overlooks the southern curve of the Rawlinswood frontier  
- **Barracks:** Only half-occupied; evidence of prior arcane siege

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Ironspur marks Baldric’s return to the military-religious fold and the start of a strategic response to mythic upheaval. It is here that the true scale of the threat becomes visible—not as prophecy, but as consequence. The stronghold’s decline mirrors the fading influence of established order and the need for a new dawn.
