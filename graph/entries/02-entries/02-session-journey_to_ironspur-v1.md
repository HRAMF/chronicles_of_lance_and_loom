**Session 02 – Journey to Ironspur**
*Campaign Title: The Waking Vow: Chronicles of the Blooming Dawn*

---

**Date of Session:** Early Spring, 1372 DR
**Setting:** From Waltzing Dale to Ironspur, Polten

---

**Summary:**
The second session marks the first proactive step in Baldric and Calanthe’s response to the prophetic omens that opened the campaign. With their children safely sent to Trailsend and Invincible summoned from Elysium, the pair prepare for flight under cover of night.

They travel swiftly through the skies above Polten, avoiding known trade routes, guided by Calanthe’s druidic instincts and Baldric’s navigator’s tools. The couple waltzes upon the pond at Waltzing Dale once more before departure—renewing their bond and planting a symbolic seed of love in sacred water.

Under a star-lit sky, the flight takes them across the region’s fractured wilds. The pair reflects on Flambard’s warning and wonders aloud about the involvement of the mysterious Dusk Riders and Priscilla’s disappearance.

Upon reaching Ironspur, they find the local Order of the Aster chapter diminished, its barracks and walls bearing scorch marks and the signs of recent magical violence. They are greeted solemnly by Flambard, and two other knights.
