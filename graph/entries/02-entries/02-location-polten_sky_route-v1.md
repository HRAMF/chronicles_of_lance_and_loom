**Name:** Polten Sky Route  
**Region:** Barony of Polten (from Waltzing Dale to Ironspur)  
**Traversed By:** Baldric and Calanthe (Session 02)  
**Method:** Flight via Invincible (Otherworldly Steed)

---

**Description:**  
A symbolic and tactical aerial route charted by Baldric and Calanthe as they journey from Waltzing Dale to Ironspur. Avoiding trade roads and scrying sigils, the couple arcs across myth-touched glades, abandoned hillshrines, and partially dormant leyline junctions. It is less a geographic corridor than a spiritual vein—echoing with premonition, silence, and stars.

**Navigational Features:**  
- **Star-Guided Orientation:** Calanthe uses constellation tracking and myth-sensitive intuition  
- **Leyline Drafting:** Baldric uses Navigator’s Tools to align their passage with safe air currents and avoid mythic hotspots  
- **Symbolic Renewal:** The route begins with a final waltz upon the waters of Waltzing Dale

**Notable Moments (Session 02):**  
- Flight under starlight begins the Blooming Vow’s resonance with the land  
- The couple reflects on Priscilla’s trail and the Dusk Riders’ ambiguity  
- The land below shows first signs of myth-bleed: fading wardlights, ash-laced fog, and whispering tree-lines

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
The route is not fixed but echo-bound—each crossing of the sky between sacred sites resonates with mythic memory. It may later serve as a template for escape, return, or ritual invocation tied to Waltzing Dale, Ironspur, and beyond.
