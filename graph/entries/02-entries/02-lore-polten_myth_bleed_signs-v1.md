**Name:** Polten Myth-Bleed  
**Category:** Environmental Phenomenon / Mythic Intrusion  
**First Identified By:** Calanthe Forgecrown and Baldric Keenglaive  
**Location:** Barony of Polten, near Rawlinswood and Ironspur

---

**Description:**  
As Baldric and Calanthe travel toward Ironspur, subtle signs emerge suggesting that myth—once confined to vision, omen, and echo—has begun to rewrite the waking world. Nature itself appears bent in places, with shifting constellations reflected in still ponds and petals blooming out of season under moonlight.

The Aster outpost at Ironspur bears physical evidence: scorched stone that resists mending, whispered voices in holy spaces, and a lingering taste of ash in the air despite no visible fire.

**Symptoms and Observations:**  
- **Temporal Drift:** Time feels slower or faster in isolated zones  
- **Sensory Loops:** Sights, smells, or sounds repeat unnaturally (birdsong, bells)  
- **Persistent Residue:** Magic leaves behind myth-echo when used in afflicted areas  
- **Warding Decay:** Consecrated objects appear dulled or emotionally muted

---

**Theoretical Cause:**  
Linked to leyline instability and the weakening of sacred anchors like the Grove of Hollowed Roots or the dormant Waking Vow. Possibly exacerbated by relics in the wrong hands or unresolved oaths.
