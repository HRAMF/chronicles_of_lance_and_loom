**Name:** Tamlorn  
**Race:** Elf  
**Class:** Druid (Circle of the Land, former high-ranking adept of the Circle of Leth)  
**Status:** Myth-Wounded but Resisting  
**Affiliation:** Circle of Leth (formerly Grove Warden)

---

**Description:**  
Tamlorn is a haunted yet resolute figure, marked by spiritual scars that shimmer faintly in moonlight—residues of myth-node exposure. His eyes bear both wisdom and weariness, and though his speech is slow, every word is chosen with the weight of one who has wrestled with myth and memory alike.

Once a grove warden among the Circle of Leth, Tamlorn was the first to survive a mythic fracture without losing himself entirely. Though no longer fully trusted by his own circle, he continues to fight to reclaim sacred spaces and protect remaining sanctity.

---

**Personality:**  
- **Trait:** Pauses before speaking, as if gauging whether the world is still real  
- **Ideal:** “Even fractured roots grow back toward the light.”  
- **Bond:** Still loyal to Arannwe, who once mentored him  
- **Flaw:** Occasionally unsure if his thoughts are his own

---

**Notable Abilities:**  
- **Myth Sense (Passive):** Can sense echo density and instability near sacred sites  
- **Voice of the Grove:** Can commune with wounded ley-threads to extract mythic patterns  
- **Scar-Ward:** His presence suppresses weaker myth illusions by disrupting recursion  
- **Rite-Weaver:** May assist Calanthe in adapting Circle rites to counter myth corruption

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Tamlorn stands as a bridge—between broken traditions and restored purpose, between mythic affliction and conscious resistance. His survival gives hope that the Circle of Leth can be reborn and that those touched by falsehoods need not be lost. He becomes both guide and symbol in the campaign’s reclamation arc.
