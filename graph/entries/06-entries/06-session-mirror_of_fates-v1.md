Session 06 – Mirror of Fates and the Root of Light
 Type: session-log
 File Name: 06-session-mirror_of_fates-v1

Opening Narrative Tag:
 As the Grove of the Blooming Vow settles into sanctified silence, the work of rooting out mythic corruption resumes. The vow blossoms, but the coliseum groans beneath false echoes. In the ruins of Dun-Tharos, destiny sharpens its blade.

Summary:
 Following the consecration of the Grove of the Blooming Vow and the discovery of the Dawnsteel Root, Baldric, Calanthe, and their allies prepare for deeper incursions into the myth-scarred wilderness of Dun-Tharos.
The party's first target is the Coliseum, a ruined amphitheater corrupted by myth. There, Tharol—the mirror-masked figure from earlier encounters—attempts to reassert his narrative dominance. However, his cowardice is publicly exposed, and the false myth he projected begins to collapse. A myth-engine disrupting seed is recovered from the heart of the arena. Once sanctified through joint ritual efforts, it is entrusted to Calanthe. This becomes the Myth-Broken Seed, a critical relic tied to the unraveling of false echoes.
From there, the group turns its attention to the Boneglass Tower, a twisted spire that resonates with a Counter-Verse—a mythically inverted echo of Baldric himself. Inside, they battle this dark reflection, a pride-twisted mockery that nearly rewrites Baldric’s legend. With Calanthe and Priscilla anchoring the truth through sacred light and story, the echo is disrupted, and the tower collapses inward.
Moving swiftly, they anticipate a counterstrike and establish an ambush near the surface-level grove known as the Grove of the Hollowed Roots. Here, Baldric masterfully goads the corrupted druids into attacking his position, only to spring the trap with his full cohort. The fight is decisive. During the battle, Arannwe is rescued from near-total mythic corruption. Tamlorn confirms her importance as a former leader of his druidic circle. With her safe, the group secures the grove.
They establish a forward encampment with the help of the Waltzing Canopy, a beautiful, mobile shelter gifted by Calanthe's circle. As evening falls, Flambard and the first contingent of the Order of the Aster arrive, rallying beneath the blooming banners of dawn and renewal.
