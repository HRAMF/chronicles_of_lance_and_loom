**Name:** Arannwe  
**Race:** Elf  
**Class:** Druid (Circle of the Land, Circle of Leth)  
**Status:** Rescued from near-total myth corruption

---

**Appearance:**  
Once tall and serene, her features are marked with deep grooves of myth-scarring. Her eyes reflect echoes of the Rot but her aura pulses with returning clarity. Since her rescue, fragments of her original grove-magic have begun to return.

---

**Personality:**  
Wise, restrained, and quietly tormented by what she almost became. Arannwe bears guilt for the Circle of Leth’s fall and resists assuming leadership, though others instinctively turn to her.

---

**Affiliations:**  
- Elder of the Circle of Leth  
- Ally of Tamlorn

---

**Key Moments:**  
- Rescued during Baldric’s ambush at the Grove of Hollowed Roots (Session 06)  
- Confirmed as a once-respected figure whose will resisted complete corruption

---

**Future Role:**  
May aid in deeper sanctification rituals and offer insight into ancient druidic rites twisted by the Rotting Man. Potential spiritual advisor to Calanthe.
