**Name:** Elversult  
**Region:** Dragon Coast, Southern Faerûn  
**Affiliation:** Independent city-state; Lords' Alliance ties  
**Known For:** Temple Hill, the Maces, trade routes, and the Risen Sun Heresy

---

**Description:**  
Elversult is a city of **wealth and contradiction**, where temples rise above markets and heresies bloom beneath sermons. Built along the banks of the River Arran, it is a city of well-maintained villas, spring-fed ponds, and silent rivalries.

Its spiritual heart, **Temple Hill**, is crowned by shrines to Lathander, Waukeen, and Helm. But as Baldric arrived, **sunlight cloaked another name**—Amaunator.

---

**Historical Role:**  
Historically a center of trade between the Sea of Fallen Stars and the western kingdoms, Elversult has long courted both prosperity and tension. The clergy of Lathander maintained a respected presence here for decades—until the rise of **Daelegoth Orndeir**.

In 1365 DR, his followers—calling themselves the **Glorious Dawn Brotherhood**—sparked doctrinal upheaval by proclaiming the **Risen Sun Heresy**: the belief that Lathander is but a phase of the long-lost Netherese god, Amaunator.

**Events or Encounters:**  
- **Adventure #8:** Baldric arrives amidst a celebration hosted by Daelegoth.  
- **Flambard abstains**, calling the movement heretical. Baldric attends the sermon, choosing understanding over isolation.  
- The city’s faithful are **divided**—some praise the Sunlord’s vision, others whisper of ambition masked as truth.

---

**Spiritual Significance:**  
Elversult is where **faith collides with form**. Where doctrine becomes spectacle. For Baldric, it marks the moment he learns that **heresy wears sunlight well**, and that discernment may require **standing in the flame without being consumed**.
