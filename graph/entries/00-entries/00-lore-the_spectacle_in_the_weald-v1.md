**Name:** The Spectacle in the Weald  
**Theme:** The tension between justice and display  
**Timeframe:** Late Spring, 1365 DR

---

**Origin:**  
Following a formal invitation from Yartar's mercantile council, Baldric agreed to lead a ceremonial **hunt for ogres** allegedly raiding grain caravans east of the city. The assembled company was a strange fellowship: priests with silken gloves, mercenaries with names like banners, and observers seated in hidden canopies to witness “the justice of the alliance.”

They rode not for righteousness—but for **optics**.

---

**Expression in the World:**  
The band tracked the ogres to the ruins of **Tartar**, an abandoned mining site swallowed by vines and bones. What followed was not a battle—it was a **display**. Trumpets sounded as steel was drawn. Witnesses took notes. And when the last ogre fell, one of the nobles wept—not for the creature, but for the *poetry of the moment*.

Baldric stood apart. He did not speak. He offered no benediction.

He simply helped bury the dead—*both ogre and man*—without separating the graves.

---

**Outcome & Legacy:**  
This moment marked Baldric’s first deep disillusionment with **theatrics of righteousness**. Though he fought with precision and protected lives, the echo it left was not one of pride, but of questioning.

In later years, when he speaks of “justice with teeth and no tongue,” he refers to this hunt. And in his private writings, he records this only as:

> *“They watched. I obeyed. And nothing was healed.”*
