**Name:** Monastery of the Sun  
**Region:** Waterdeep, Sword Coast  
**Affiliation:** Lathanderite Church, Order of the Sun Soul  

---

**Description:**  
The Monastery of the Sun crowns one of Waterdeep’s higher terraces, surrounded by flowering gardens, dawn-lit columns, and tiled courtyards. Its sacred architecture directs morning light into its central sanctum, where the rising sun is not just honored—but channeled.

Monks of the Sun Soul tradition train in radiant harmony—moving through disciplines of form, philosophy, and divine spellwork. It is not a fortress, nor a cathedral, but a rhythm of light carved into stone.

---

**Historical Role:**  
Since its founding after the Time of Troubles, the Monastery has grown into a spiritual waypoint for Lathanderites seeking balance between physical discipline and spiritual renewal. It has long served as a bastion of *dawn philosophy*—where redemption, vitality, and forward motion are held as sacred truths.

**Spiritual/Strategic Significance:**  
To Lathanderites and sun-soul aspirants, the Monastery is a sacred rehearsal of dawn itself. Its rhythms inform doctrine not by commandment, but by presence: awakening, motion, intention. Here, light is not just protection—it is a **vow**.
