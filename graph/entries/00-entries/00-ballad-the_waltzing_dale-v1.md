**The Waltzing Dale**  
*(Performed in the Autumn Courts, Year 1367 DR)*  
*A song of devotion, resonance, and vow*  

---

**[Intro – Solo Voice, Slow and Clear]**  
No herald called it holy ground,  
No seal was placed upon its mound.  
But where two hearts in silence swayed—  
A name, a vow, a bloom was laid.  

---

**[Verse I – Soft, Reflective]**  
She came with stars still in her braid,  
He met her where the waters stayed.  
No script, no crown, no temple gold—  
Just flame and sky and fingers bold.  

---

**[Chorus – Crescendo, Rising with Strings]**  
Oh dance the dale, where love was sewn,  
Where stillness sang and time was known.  
Their vow was light, their oath was room—  
They named it then—**Of Lance and Loom.**  
The stars aligned, the sun stood still—  
The dale became their home, their will.  

---

**[Verse II – Reverent, Almost Whispered]**  
He did not kneel with sword in hand,  
She did not beg the sky to stand.  
They danced upon the mirror’s breath,  
And bound the world with life, not death.  

---

**[Bridge – Soaring, Voice and Harp Only]**  
She spun the thread the dawn would wear,  
He held the sun without a glare.  
And from their steps the earth took note—  
The pond, the hill, the breath, the throat…  

---

**[Chorus – Strong, Echoed with Choir]**  
Oh dance the dale, oh bloom the vow,  
Let starlight crown the furrowed brow.  
Where silence bore a lover’s tune—  
It woke the land—**Of Lance and Loom.**  
The waltz remains in every field,  
A vow the land itself now yields.  

---

**[Outro – Soft Return, Bare Voice]**  
So if you pass the hidden glade,  
Where no wind stirs and petals fade…  
You’ll feel it still, beneath your heel—  
The place where stars and fire kneeled.
