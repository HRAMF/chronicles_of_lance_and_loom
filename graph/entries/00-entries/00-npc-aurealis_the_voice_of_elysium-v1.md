Description:
Auréalis is a Solar Angel, one of the greatest of the divine host, whose presence is known not by words but by the harmony it invokes. When Auréalis manifests in dreams, his arrival is heralded by golden radiance, choral resonance, and the scent of sunlit cedar. His form is both humanoid and unknowable—his wings more light than feather, his eyes twin dawns.

Known in celestial circles as the Aspect of Valor, Auréalis embodies courage without cruelty, power without pride, and leadership born of compassion. He is the guiding hand of action tempered by mercy—a living balance of grace and will.

He is revered as the herald of sacred convergence—appearing not to command, but to counsel, and only to those who walk between the laws of heaven and the longings of mortal love.

Role in Baldric’s Story:
Auréalis has been a silent mentor to Baldric Keenglaive since childhood, manifesting only in dream, trance, or during moments of spiritual upheaval. He does not instruct with sermons, but with visions—scenes of harmony through courage, of fire tempered by grace. Other angels of lesser choirs occasionally visit Baldric under Auréalis’s direction.

First appeared to Baldric shortly after his arrival at the Monastery of the Sun

Guided Baldric’s understanding of balance: valor without wrath, purity without judgment

Offered visions of Elysium’s Choir, where divine voices hold the Weave steady through shared resonance



---

Known Traits and Powers (dream context only):

Voice of the Choral Will: His presence can harmonize discordant Weave fluctuations, even in myth-saturated environments

Solar Resonance: Inspires holy clarity, radiant magic, and acts of sacrifice rooted in peace

Memory Flame: Each visit leaves a faint thread of warmth in the soul; can be reactivated in prayer, song, or sacred vow



---

Personality:

Serene, patient, and unwaveringly compassionate

Honors mortal agency; never imposes direction

His silence is a space for revelation, not absence



---

Narrative Significance:
Auréalis is Baldric’s celestial ideal, his mythic compass. As the myth of the Blooming Vow grows, Auréalis may yet appear again—not as a guide, but as a witness, recognizing in Baldric the rarest of paths: one not dictated by fate, but grown from sacred choice. In doing so, he affirms Baldric’s emergence as a mortal echo of valor—not through domination, but devotion.
