**Narrative:**  
Before she was named **the Ieriyn**, before her vows rippled through myth and grove alike, Calanthe Forgecrown lived beneath painted ceilings and gilded expectations.

She was born in **Impiltur**, to the noble house of Forgecrown—descendants of kings, advisers to thrones, keepers of law and blood and court. Her name was measured in whispers long before it was spoken.

But she heard other things.

Not the rustle of tapestries or the clink of wine over polished marble—she heard **root-creak beneath stone**, the sigh of moss, the stars murmuring patterns no map could hold.

**The Drift from Ceremony:**  
At thirteen, she stopped reciting the bloodlines.  
At fourteen, she walked barefoot into the Gray Forest and came back days later, smiling and unafraid.  
At fifteen, she refused the harp but learned the rhythm of **lichen and silence**.

The druids of the **Circle of Leth** did not name her gifted.  
They named her **correct**.

---

**Starweaver’s Awakening:**  
She did not take the stars as her domain.  
She listened to them.

Her magic bloomed not in spectacle, but in **pattern**. The circle taught her that each life was a rhythm, and healing came not from dominance, but from **restored resonance**.

She began to weave joy into her magic, not as decoration—but as **resistance**.  
She protected fields from court-hungry barons, taught shepherds when to sow by moonrise, and punished those who burned for convenience.

The people of Hlammach called her *Lady of the Verdant Flame*.  
The forest called her **home**.

---

**The First Turning:**  
She met **Baldric Keenglaive** not in ballrooms or battlefields, but along the contested borders where Damara and Impiltur press against the land’s wound. There, among shadowed stone and half-forgotten oaths, they did not fall in love.

They *recognized*.

He saw the stillness that could hold his fire.  
She saw the light that did not demand her bending.

And the stars… moved.

---

**Symbolic Echo:**  
She is not the one who charges forward.  
She is the one who keeps **charting where forward even is**.

Calanthe is the rhythm beneath the vow, the hand that catches the blade after it strikes, the gaze that says: “There is more.”

**Closing Thought:**  
> Before she was the Ieriyn, she was already enough.  
> She simply needed a sky that listened.
