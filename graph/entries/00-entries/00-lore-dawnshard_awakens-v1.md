**Name:** Dawnshard Awakens  
**Theme:** Inheritance, radiant relics, purification through release  
**Timeframe:** Late Autumn, 1365 DR

---

**Origin:**  
Beneath the lower sanctums of **Durlag’s Tower**, past illusions of torment and soul-locked doors, Baldric reached a chamber unlike the rest—clean, silent, untouched by decay.

At its center knelt a spectral knight—unnamed, faceless, draped in shattered solar vestments. Bound not by chains, but by **oath unfulfilled**.

The knight had once served the **Order of the Aster**, dispatched to the Tower in ages past to cleanse what holy rites could not. He failed—not for lack of strength, but for refusing to abandon his companions. In their final stand, he hid the relic he bore: a radiant weapon sanctified by Lathander himself.

He died nameless. But his hope did not.

**Expression in the World:**  
Baldric did not demand the weapon. He listened. He knelt. And when the spirit asked, *“Will you carry what I could not?”*—he said only:

> “I do not carry it for glory. I carry it for dawn.”

The soul released its hold.

The altar stone split in a golden seam, and from within rose the **Dawnshard**—a radiant **lance**, its shaft of silverwood, its tip etched with Lathander’s sigil in flame-etched electrum. It pulsed not with fire, but with **reverent light**.

---

**Outcome & Legacy:**  
The room brightened as the knight vanished—his form trailing sunlit dust. The other spirits, once feral and cyclical, fell quiet. Some wept. Others simply ceased.

The Tower’s curse was not lifted—but it was **soothed**.

Baldric emerged carrying a weapon not forged for him—but **awaiting him**.

Since that day, the Dawnshard has never left his side. It does not blaze in anger—it answers to **oath, clarity, and choice**.
