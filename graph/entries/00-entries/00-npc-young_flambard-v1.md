**Name:** Cyrus Flambard (Young)  
**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Paladin (Oath of Devotion)  
**Affiliation:** Order of the Aster, Spires of the Morning  
**Title at Time:** Sword-Sergeant of the Radiant Table

**Description:**  
Before becoming the iron-voiced Knight-Commander known across Damara, **Cyrus Flambard** was once a rising Sword-Sergeant of Waterdeep—a man bound more by conviction than certainty.

Young Flambard was defined by rigor, polish, and belief in systems. He was not yet weathered, but already **unyielding**. While he was not cruel, he was precise to a fault, believing **clarity was kindness** and deviation a disservice to both god and brethren.

**Role in Baldric’s Story:**  
At the **Spires of the Morning**, Flambard was Baldric’s first true institutional mentor. He did not understand the child’s softness, nor his poetic reflection—but he respected his skill, and saw the makings of a knight worthy of oaths.

He taught Baldric swordform, command structure, and battlefield logic. He did not smile often, but he watched closely. And in that watchfulness, Baldric learned not only technique—but how one might **enforce light without extinguishing its warmth**.

**Personality and Voice (at the time):**  
- Driven, exacting, always punctual  
- Speaks like scripture—short, final, and absolute  
- Rarely jokes, but respects sincerity

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Young Flambard did not shape Baldric’s beliefs—but he shaped his spine. His presence gave structure to ideals that might otherwise have floated in sunlight.

In later years, their relationship would strain as myth and command diverged. But it began in mutual recognition: one of potential, the other of form.
