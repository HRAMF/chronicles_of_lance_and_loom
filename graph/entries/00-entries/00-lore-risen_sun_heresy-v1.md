**Name:** The Risen Sun Heresy  
**Theme:** Doctrine, discernment, spectacle  
**Timeframe:** Early Winter, 1365 DR

---

**Origin:**  
As Baldric and Flambard entered **Elversult**, they found its temples draped not in sunrise silk—but **golden flame**. The **Glorious Dawn Brotherhood** had transformed Temple Hill into a theater of worship, with **Daelegoth Orndeir** as its prophet.

The teachings were clear: Lathander was no longer a youthful god of rebirth, but a **manifestation of Amaunator**, the lost sun-god of law and flame.

Flambard refused to attend.  
Baldric did not.

---

**Expression in the World:**  
The **Banquet of the Risen Sun** was a celebration veiled as a sermon.  
Paladins and priests raised goblets between verses. The crowd shimmered in dawn-glow glamour. Orndeir spoke of **illumination**, of **cycles ending**, of **truth long obscured by softness**.

When asked to speak, Baldric rose.

But he did not preach.

> “Faith is a flame, yes—but not all light consumes.  
> The dawn does not command—it invites.  
> The sun that gives life must not scorch it.”

He left before the applause finished.

---

**Outcome & Legacy:**  
Baldric did not denounce the Brotherhood outright. But neither did he lend his name.

Elversult remains torn.

To some, Baldric’s silence was a quiet refusal.  
To others, it was **a sign that even the Dawn Peregrine listens when the sun shifts.**

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
This moment marks the beginning of Baldric’s **spiritual independence**—his refusal to be politicized by any movement, even those cloaked in his god’s name.

It also marks the first public moment where his legend is **interpreted** rather than **embodied**.
