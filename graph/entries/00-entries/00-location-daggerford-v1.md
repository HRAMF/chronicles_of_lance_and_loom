**Name:** Daggerford  
**Region:** The Western Heartlands, along the Delimbiyr River  
**Affiliation:** Duchy under the Lords’ Alliance  
**Known For:** Modest castle, dockside markets, the River Shining, and frequent Zhentarim intrigue

---

**Description:**  
Daggerford is a city caught between ambitions. Larger than a village, smaller than a power, it clings to the edge of the Trade Way like a barge tethered too close to a storm. Soldiers walk in half-shined boots. Merchants preach caution louder than price. And beneath it all, **coin speaks clearly**.

To Baldric, it is a place of potential—tilted always toward danger or deliverance.

---

**Historical Role:**  
Long a waypoint between Waterdeep and the southern kingdoms, Daggerford has seen caravans, crusades, and cloaked conspiracies pass through its gates. Though ruled by a noble family, true influence often lies with the **merchant consortiums**, the riverfolk, and whispered affiliations with **the Zhentarim**.

---

**Events or Encounters:**  
- **Arms in Barrels:** While surveying the docks during a civic inspection, Baldric notices the weight and resonance of barrels being loaded by the **Mariner’s Alliance**. Within: crates of weapons—hidden beneath salted fish.  
- **The Bribe:** Before raising alarm, Baldric is approached quietly and offered a **magical amulet**, no questions asked.  
- **The Disruption:** Rather than draw steel, Baldric **creates a commotion**—deliberately drawing the attention of patrolling guards until the conspirators have no exit.

---

**Spiritual Significance:**  
Daggerford tests a different virtue: **incorruptibility without sanctimony**. It is not a place for speeches—but for presence. For reminding the quiet folk that someone sees, and will not look away.

Baldric left the amulet behind. But he did not leave unnoticed.
