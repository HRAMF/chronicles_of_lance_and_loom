**Name:** Beregost  
**Region:** The Sword Coast, midway between Baldur’s Gate and Nashkel  
**Affiliation:** Independent town with strong ties to the Church of Lathander  
**Known For:** The Temple of the Morning Song, the ruins of the Ulcaster School, caravan traffic

---

**Description:**  
Beregost rests like a lantern in the fog—warm with faith, yet surrounded by whispers. It is a town of pilgrims, tanners, and slow caravans. At dawn, bells ring for Morninglord services. At night, travelers speak of **shadows near the old school walls**.

To Baldric, Beregost was not a battleground. It was a **crossroads between belief and decay**.

---

**Historical Role:**  
The town flourished briefly during the age of the **Ulcaster School of Magic**, now in ruins. Many locals avoid its grounds, claiming echoes still wander beneath the earth. Yet Beregost remains devout—home to a humble but well-tended temple of Lathander.

**Events or Encounters:**  
- **Rite of Respect:** Baldric visits the Temple of the Morning Song to give offerings and assist with livestock care.  
- **Ghostly Petition:** At sunset, he is called by the **spirit of Ulcaster**, who pleads for intervention—necromantic activity is defiling the school’s remnants.  
- **Suspicion in Courtship:** The nobles **Arkion** and **Nemphre**, once lovers, are each suspected. Their gifts—Arkion holding Nemphre’s necklace, Nemphre with Arkion’s ring—hint at **something lost and twisted**.

---

**Spiritual Significance:**  
Beregost tests Baldric’s ability to **listen to the past**, not just shape the future. Here, truth cannot be drawn by blade—but must be **exhumed** from memory, longing, and the shadow of pride.
