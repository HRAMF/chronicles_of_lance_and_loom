**Lyrics:**

*Verse I*  
There came no horn, no holy flame—  
No name upon his brow—  
Yet through the dark, the falcon flew,  
And ogres learned to bow.  

Steel rang like light on morning leaves,  
The dawn cut through the screams.  
And those who watched from bloodied grass  
Would carry him in dreams.  

*Chorus*  
So toss a flame to the Dawn Peregrine,  
Knight of the light, and shadow’s chagrin.  
For when the sun forgets to rise,  
He burns it through the dim.  

Oh—toss a flame to the Dawn Peregrine,  
And ride the storm with him.  

*Verse II*  
The bards had ink, the nobles cheers,  
But none knew what he'd done.  
He buried dead from both the sides—  
Then rose before the sun.  

He asked no coin, he sang no hymn,  
He spoke no vow aloud.  
Yet in that hush, the land took note—  
And wrapped him in its shroud.  

*Chorus*  
Toss a flame to the Dawn Peregrine,  
Knight of the hush, and storm’s violin.  
He does not boast. He does not break—  
He shines where fear had been.  

Oh—toss a flame to the Dawn Peregrine,  
And rise, reborn again.

**Performance Notes:**  
The ballad is now played across the North in hushed taverns and hopeful sanctuaries alike. Many don’t know who the Dawn Peregrine is. Some say he’s a celestial. Others, a ghost. But Priscilla has never corrected them.

She only plays—eyes closed—until the last note lingers like breath before a prayer.
