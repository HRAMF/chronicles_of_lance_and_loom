**Summary:**  
Composed in the wake of the Grove of Yilth’s reconsecration, *The Ballad of the Blooming Vow* is Priscilla’s bardic response to the mythic falsehoods imposed by the Rotting Man. It chronicles the sacred unity of Baldric and Calanthe—not as legend, but as lived truth. The ballad is said to “teach the land how to remember,” harmonizing with the very Weave of the realm. It is sung as both lullaby and invocation, capable of calming echo-churned nodes and rallying sacred resolve.

**Opening Verses:**  
> In the heart of a forest where silence grew loud,  
A knight found his truth, and his oath he avowed.  
Not with blade, but with vow, and with feet in the loam,  
He danced with his love, and called the land home.  

> The rot spoke in riddles, in lies dressed as flame,  
But the land chose their laughter, and carved it in name.  
So where blight once whispered and memory fell…  
Now rises the Blooming Vow, where new dawns dwell.  

---

**Closing Lines (Invocation):**  
> Let roots hold the promise and light shape the truth,  
Let star-seeded soil remember their youth.  
Where one walks with purpose, and two speak as one—  
There blooms the vow beneath each rising sun.

**Symbolic Weight:**  
- Echoes Baldric and Calanthe’s mythic symmetry (sun and soil, dawn and seed)  
- Reinforces the sigil of the Blooming Vow as a metaphysical emblem  
- May be used by Priscilla or others to anchor sanctification rites or resist myth recursion
