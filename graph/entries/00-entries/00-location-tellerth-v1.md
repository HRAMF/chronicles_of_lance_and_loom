**Name:** Tellerth  
**Region:** Barony of Polten, Eastern Damara  
**Affiliation:** House Keenglaive (de jure); often bypassed by other powers  
**Known For:** Waystation market, chapel of the Flame Lily, sightings of the Dusk Riders

---

**Description:**  
Tellerth lies at the foot of the Rawlinswood, where the frost creeps into the earth by autumn and the fog never quite lifts at dawn. It is a modest village of stone hearths and soot-stained banners, once fortified against Vaasans, now quiet.

To most, it is the last warm bed before the wild. To Baldric, it is the edge of his family’s legacy—and the place where the **law of the barony begins to blur**.

---

**Historical Role:**  
Tellerth served as a northern mustering point during the Bloodstone Wars. After peace was won, it faded to a crossroads—kept afloat by traders from Impiltur and pilgrims bound for the Druid Circles of the forest.

More recently, it has become a place of **omission**—where riders pass at dusk, cloaked and unchallenged.

**Events or Encounters:**  
- **Adventure #10:** Upon returning to Polten, Baldric watches the **Dusk Riders** pass through Tellerth.  
- Their horses do not slow. The village watch does not stir.  
- Baldric notes the villagers’ silence—**reverent**, not fearful.  
- They ride east before dawn. No names left. No banners unfurled.

---

**Spiritual Significance:**  
Tellerth teaches Baldric that not all power bears seal or chain. That **oaths can be spoken without jurisdiction**, and **duties may answer to older laws**. The Riders do not defy him—they ignore him. And that, perhaps, is worse.
