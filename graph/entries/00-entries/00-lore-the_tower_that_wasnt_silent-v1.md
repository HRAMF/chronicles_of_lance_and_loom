**Name:** The Tower That Wasn’t Silent  
**Theme:** Strategy, survival, reclamation  
**Timeframe:** Midwinter, 1365 DR

---

**Origin:**  
Caught in a nightstorm while sailing across the **Sea of Fallen Stars**, Baldric and his retinue were cast against the reefed edge of a black island. Their ship broke beneath them—lured not by salvation, but by a **false beacon**.

The **Starfall Watchtower**, once a flame of faith, had become a predator’s perch—its light replaced with **alchemical lures**, its bell chamber overtaken by a **monstrous, winged beast**.

---

**Expression in the World:**  
The survivors were few, but able. Baldric took no time for despair.

- He studied the land’s shape, the wind’s path, and the predator’s cycles.
- He **mapped routes** beneath the cliffs, using line and echo to determine which caves could be sealed.  
- He reclaimed the tower in stages—first the stair, then the bell platform, then the lantern post.  
- The creature struck at dusk. Baldric struck back **with silence, sunburst, and signal**.

When the final blow landed, the cliff shook. The bell, long rusted, **rang once**. Not loudly. But clearly.

---

**Outcome & Legacy:**  
The false lights were shattered. The tower’s altar was rededicated with a single prayer.

By the time they were rescued, three days later, the beacon burned once more—its light fueled by Baldric’s hand and faith alike.

To those who were there, this was the moment they began calling him not just knight—but **Warden**.  
He had not just fought. He had **preserved**.
