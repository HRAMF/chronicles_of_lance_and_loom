**Name:** Twilight Watches Us All  
**Theme:** Sovereignty, silence, mythic ambiguity  
**Timeframe:** First Spring of 1366 DR

---

**Origin:**  
Baldric had returned to **Damara**.

Not as exile. Not as pilgrim. But as the son of Wycbuhr Keenglaive—heir to Polten, bearer of divine light, wielder of the Dawnshard, and Warden to come.

But his banner did not fly alone.

On the road beyond **Tellerth**, as morning struggled to rise through the frost, a **column of riders** passed from the woods, cloaked in smoke and silence. Their eyes forward. Their weapons unbloodied. Their path—unchallenged.

**The Dusk Riders.**

---

**Expression in the World:**  
No herald rode before them. No trumpet blared. But still, the villagers stood back.

- Their cloaks bore **no sigils**.  
- Their route did not match any caravan trail.  
- Their presence was known, but **not explained**.

And when the lead rider passed Baldric, he met his gaze.

He did not salute. He did not bow.

He only saw—and kept riding.

---

**Outcome & Legacy:**  
Baldric did not stop them. He did not speak. He only turned to Flambard later and asked:

> *“What law governs a man who does not speak his oath?”*

To which Flambard answered:

> *“That is not our question. The question is whether he rides to keep it—or to break it.”*

The encounter would haunt Baldric’s early months as **Warden of Polten**. He would chart their movements, speak to those they passed, attempt to discern their allegiance.

But their answer, when it came, was always the same:

**“We ride for Damara. Not for its lords.”**
