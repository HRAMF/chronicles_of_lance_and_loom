**Description:**  
Kane is a monk of legend—an ascetic whose name is spoken across the steppes of Damara in tones of reverence and awe. Tall and gaunt, wrapped in layered gray robes, Kane’s presence is quiet and still, like the high air itself. He speaks rarely, but when he does, his words echo far beyond the moment.

He is known as a master of memory and meditation, a keeper of sacred insight and forgotten truths. His vision of the divine is not liturgical—it is *experiential*, *intuitive*, and *silent*. To him, the path of Ilmater is not one of suffering alone, but of **resilience forged in meaning**.

**Role in Baldric’s Story:**  
It was Kane who first read the divine light blooming within Baldric Keenglaive. When others saw danger or miracle, Kane saw **purpose**—not for himself, but for Baldric. He named the journey westward a *pilgrimage*, not a banishment, and ensured that **Brother Gylas** would serve as companion and guide.

Though their contact was brief, Kane’s clarity of vision left a profound impression on Baldric’s spiritual narrative. He did not give orders—he gave **permission to become**.

---

**Personality and Voice:**  
- Quiet, deliberate, and perpetually reflective  
- Speaks in unembellished truths, never seeking to impress or convince  
- Believes strength lies in understanding the meaning of pain—not escaping it

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Kane is a figure of catalytic stillness. He is the one who opens the door—but never walks through it. His belief in Baldric’s potential reframed what others called risk as promise. His trust set the stage for all that would follow.
