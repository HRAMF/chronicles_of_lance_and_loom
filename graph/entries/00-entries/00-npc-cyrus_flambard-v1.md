**Description:**  
Cyrus Flambard is the iron voice of Lathander’s militant order in Damara. His countenance is stern, his words chosen with purpose, and his bearing evokes the uncompromising clarity of a morning sun at its zenith. A lifelong soldier and reformer, he believes in the rule of law, the sacred power of oaths, and the righteous necessity of command.

A tall, broad-shouldered man with graying temples and a burnished sun medallion always visible at his chest, Flambard inspires equal parts fear and admiration among his subordinates.
