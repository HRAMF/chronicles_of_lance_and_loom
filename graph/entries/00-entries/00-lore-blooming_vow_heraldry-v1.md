**Blazon (Heraldic Description):**  
**“Or, a spiral vert encircled by laurels proper, surmounted by a demi-sun radiant gules rising from the base, on a field argent. Border charged with petals sable and gold.”**

Translated:  
- A **green spiral** (representing life and druidic memory)  
- Surrounded by **living laurel branches** (symbolizing victory, rebirth, and healing)  
- **Rising from below** is a **half-sun in red-gold** (signifying Lathander’s light, reborn)  
- The background is a **field of silver-white**, denoting clarity and sanctity  
- A **border of alternating black and golden petals** encircles the emblem, hinting at death undone and life restored

**Visual Description (Symbol in the World):**  
At first glance, the crest evokes harmony: **the spiral of the earth**, **the laurels of nature**, and **the sun’s rise from below**. But it is more than a symbol—it pulses faintly with resonance in hallowed places.

- **The Spiral**: Always open-ended, never closing, representing an oath still unfolding  
- **The Laurel Ring**: Woven as if from real ivy and bay leaves; artists often render it growing outward beyond the crest’s frame  
- **The Rising Sun**: A red-orange half-disc, emitting eight stylized rays (mirroring the 8 tenets of the Paladin’s devotion)  
- **Background & Petal Border**: Meant to “frame truth”—the petals are said to “change color” under mythic influence

This emblem is etched onto Baldric’s cloak lining and sewn into the base of Calanthe’s new ritual robe. The first Aster banner to bear it now flies above the reclaimed grove.
