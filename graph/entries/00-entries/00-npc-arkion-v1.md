*File Name: 00-npc-arkion-v1*  
*Type: npc-entry*

---

**Name:** Arkion  
**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Necromancer (formerly Diviner)  
**Alignment:** Neutral (tinted with obsession)  
**Affiliation:** Noble of Beregost (disinherited), freelance arcanist  

---

**Role in Narrative:**  
Once a promising diviner trained in the fading halls of the Ulcaster School, Arkion now walks the slow spiral of ambition turned to bitterness. After his romantic and scholarly bond with Nemphre collapsed, he withdrew from society, studying rituals that promised control over loss—not in life, but **after it**.

Baldric encounters Arkion as a suspect in the ghost Ulcaster’s petition—found with a **necklace once belonging to Nemphre**, extracted from the ruins of their shared past.

**Personality and Voice:**  
- Cold, analytical, unsentimental—but carries a deep loneliness  
- His voice is slow, as if each word passes through memory before it lands  
- Denies wrongdoing, but doesn’t disguise his **obsessive curiosity**  
- Speaks of death not with fear, but with **regret harnessed into ritual**

---

**Key Moments with Baldric:**  
- Confronted in a quiet study, surrounded by notes written in two hands—his and Nemphre’s  
- Offers a theory: that the objects they retrieve act as **mirrors**—letting them relive their bond without reconciliation  
- Accepts Baldric’s authority, but not without challenging his sense of mercy:  
  > *“Tell me, paladin… if love haunts us after death, is it not mercy to speak with it?”*

**Narrative Significance:**  
Arkion is not the villain. He is **the temptation of memory**—the need to relive, revise, reframe what has been broken. His magic is not evil—but it is hungry. And in his hunger, he risks turning the ruins of Ulcaster into an echo chamber of the heart.
