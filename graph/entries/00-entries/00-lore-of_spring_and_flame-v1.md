**Name:** Of Spring and Flame  
**Theme:** Love, convergence, cosmic alignment  
**Timeframe:** Spring of 1366 DR

---

**Narrative:**  
The wedding of **Calanthe Forgecrown** and **Baldric Keenglaive** was not held in court, nor under cathedral arch.  
It bloomed in **the Waltzing Dale**—a quiet hollow of untouched grass, spring-fed waters, and starlit mornings.

They named it together.  
And beneath the new leaves and open sky, they gave the world a vow it had long forgotten.

---

**The Lovers’ Preparation:**  
Baldric planted his lance in the ground—not as a weapon, but as a root.  
Calanthe circled the pond’s edge, barefoot, whispering to the water, the saplings, the sky.

There were no guards, no council, no seal.

Only a bard, a stag, and the sky itself.

---

**The Ceremony:**  
At dawn, they stood upon the still water.  
Not above it—*with* it.

And they danced.

Not as nobles.  
Not as symbols.  
As themselves.

> The Starweaver and the Heaven’s Strength.  
> Spring and Flame.  
> Calanthe and Baldric.

Their laughter rang like bells across the stone. Their hands found rhythm, not choreography. Their gaze held more than promise—it held *presence*.

---

**What Stirred:**  
The land answered in bloom.  
The birdsong shifted to a new cadence.  
The waters beneath their feet held, not through magic, but **agreement**.

And the leyline that slumbered beneath the dale woke—not in rupture, but in **chord**.

Later, it would be named **The Concord Line**.

---

**Witnesses:**  
- **Priscilla Callonetta**, bard of the Yawning Portal, who would pen *The Ballad of Spring and Flame*  
- A white stag with eyes like cloud-split moonlight  
- A chorus of unseen stars, realigned above the pond

---

**Closing Image:**  
At the final step of their waltz, Baldric whispered the vow he had crafted in secret.  
Calanthe answered not in words, but in kiss.

The pond did not ripple.

The world held its breath.
