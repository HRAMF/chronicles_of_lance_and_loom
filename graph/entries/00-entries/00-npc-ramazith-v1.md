**Role in Narrative:**  
Ramazith approaches Baldric under a banner of charm and civility. He offers gifts in exchange for the transfer of the nymph—claiming he would offer her “a sanctuary suited to her divine nature.” Unlike Ragefast, Ramazith **knows how wrong his offer is**, but **makes it beautifully anyway**.

He is the kind of man who would trade holiness for story rights—and do it with a smile.

---

**Personality and Voice:**  
- Urbane, magnetic, precise in his enunciations  
- Lives for the edge of things: morality, politics, myth  
- Speaks in layered metaphors, preferring innuendo to command  
- Every conversation is both a test and a performance

---

**Key Moments with Baldric:**  
- Meets Baldric with flattery, subtle reverence, and plausible deniability  
- Attempts to reframe the nymph’s fate as *opportunity*, not *ownership*  
- Upon refusal, does not rage—he *smiles wider*, as if adding the moment to his archive

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Ramazith is the serpent in velvet—not evil, but ever coiled. He embodies the temptation not of violence, but of **transactional truth**.

He is the kind of man who says:
> *“It is not theft if what’s beautiful chooses to be admired.”*
