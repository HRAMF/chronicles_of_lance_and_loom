**Name:** The Wound in the Stone  
**Theme:** First failure, grief, and the birth of strategic discipline  
**Timeframe:** High Summer, 1365 DR

**Origin:**  
The Yawning Portal had always been dangerous. But this time, it bled.

During Baldric’s return to Waterdeep, a **pack of ghouls** escaped Undermountain through a collapsed sewer run beneath the Castle Ward. They emerged into the streets before Baldric and his gathered knights could establish containment.

Eight civilians were killed—three of them children. Their bodies were found torn and half-eaten beneath broken market stalls and banner stands.

The horror broke something in him.

**Expression in the World:**  
Baldric’s response was swift—but not swift enough. He led a counterstrike, personally sealing the breach and destroying every ghoul. He established rotating patrols. He mapped the spill zone. He traced the arcane fault line and blessed the perimeter with radiant glyphs.

But no sermon followed. No statue was raised. No ballad composed.

Only **a shift**.

From that day forward, Baldric began to measure every step more carefully.  
Every hallway mapped. Every spell chosen for coverage. Every ally placed with precision.

He would not fail again.

**Outcome & Legacy:**  
This was **the wound in the stone**—the moment the Dawn Peregrine stopped hoping light would be enough, and began learning how to **cast it with consequence**.

Priscilla, who had traveled with him from Yartar, offered soft words in private. She never wrote them down. And never would.

Some memories are not meant for rhyme.  
Some vows are **made in silence**.
