**Description:**  
Priscilla is a sharp-witted, velvet-voiced bard known for her gift of memory, empathy, and dangerous curiosity. Having once traveled across the Heartlands collecting tales of dawn and ruin, she stumbled upon Baldric and Calanthe’s unfolding myth—and chose to stay. She dresses flamboyantly, laughs easily, and has an uncanny knack for speaking uncomfortable truths with disarming elegance.

Though not a knight, she’s earned respect from Flambard’s inner circle and is often called upon when diplomacy, insight, or creative subterfuge is needed.

**Personality:**  
- **Trait:** Uses humor to navigate grief and fear  
- **Ideal:** Memory is sacred—especially the painful kind  
- **Bond:** Believes in the legend Baldric refuses to claim for himself  
- **Flaw:** Has trouble discerning when she’s documenting a story vs. becoming part of one

**Notable Abilities:**  
- **Bardic Inspiration (d8):** Often reserved for moments of emotional truth  
- **Countercharm:** Frequently used during myth-node exposure to shield allies  
- **Lore Recall:** May “remember” verses or prophecies long before they're written  
- **Signature Spell:** *Legend Lore*, used only when intuition demands it

**Narrative Significance:**  
Priscilla serves as the living chronicler of the Waking Vow and the Blooming Vow within it. Her ballads may one day become canon in bardic colleges—and her versions of events often shape how others perceive the truth. When myth threatens to overwrite memory, it is Priscilla’s voice that calls back what is real.
