**Role in Narrative:**  
Ragefast is the mage said to be **keeping a nymph captive** within his household. Unlike common villains, Ragefast is not overtly cruel or villainous. He sees himself as a guardian of dangerous beauty—a scholar preserving power rather than exploiting it.

To Baldric, he represents the dangers of **intellectual justification**: a man who commits quiet violations in the name of protection.

**Personality and Voice:**  
- Measured, polite, overly clinical  
- Believes beauty is too powerful to be left unchecked  
- Speaks in rhetorical questions and veiled warnings  
- Keeps wards not just on doors—but on *truths*

**Key Moments with Baldric:**  
- Accepts Baldric’s questioning with veiled superiority  
- Speaks of the nymph as “a creature of unpredictable influence”  
- Is unsettled not by accusation—but by the silence Baldric returns when offered reassurances

**Narrative Significance:**  
Ragefast is not a monster—but he *is* a mirror. He shows what happens when intellect severs empathy. In Baldric’s memory, he is not hated—but **pitied**.
