**Name:** The False Sun Heresy  
**Category:** Religious Schism / Mythic Distortion  
**First Recognized By:** Baldric Keenglaive (Session 03)  
**Location of Origin (Unconfirmed):** Herondale, Dun-Tharos fringe, or Mirror Cult strongholds

**Description:**  
The False Sun Heresy refers to a growing mythic movement that conflates Lathander, the Morninglord, with Amaunator—the harsh, judicial deity of the ancient Netherese pantheon. While once considered separate (or cyclically connected) entities, this heresy asserts that the **Sun God is one**, and that the warm glow of Lathander is merely the juvenile form of Amaunator's “true” face.

Proponents of this heresy twist dawnlight into judgment and renewal into recurrence. They believe the Sun must rise at its highest and burn away illusion—even at the cost of innocence or mercy. The mythic echoes tied to this belief appear to infect symbols, mirrors, and rituals aligned with identity, justice, or penance.

**Known Tenets (Recovered Fragments):**  
- “The Morning is a Lie; Only Noon is Truth.”  
- “In the Mirror of the Dawn, the True Light is Revealed.”  
- “Return the Law to the Sun; Burn the Blooming Vow.”

**Mythic Indicators:**  
- Sun motifs that do not cast warmth  
- Radiance accompanied by silence or flame without heat  
- Reflections that show figures of authority masked in gold, but hollow  

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
This heresy presents a thematic and metaphysical threat to Baldric’s divine alignment. It seeks to overwrite the truth of Lathander with a mythic authority rooted in static hierarchy and unyielding order. As the party descends deeper into myth-node corruption, signs of this doctrine are expected to reappear, especially near corrupted solar relics and mirror-based trials.

**Connected Sessions:**  
- Session 03 (sigils and speech from broken sister, mirror-node imagery)  
- Session 05–06 (potential return in corrupted rites or relic activations)
