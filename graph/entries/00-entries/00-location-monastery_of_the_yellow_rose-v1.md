**Name:** Monastery of the Yellow Rose  
**Region:** Earthspur Mountains, Damara  
**Affiliation:** Order of Ilmater (Yellow Rose)

---

**Description:**  
Perched in the high steppes of the Earthspur Mountains, the Monastery of the Yellow Rose is a windswept sanctuary where silence holds greater weight than doctrine. Carved into stone and ice, its halls are sparse, austere, and beautifully still. It is a monastery that teaches **resilience through endurance**, **faith through humility**, and **wisdom through patient suffering**.

The monks of the Yellow Rose are famed not only for their physical discipline and memory arts, but for their unwavering compassion. Their way is one of *sacred quietude*—where strength is measured not in dominance, but in devotion.

---

**Historical Role:**  
For centuries, the Monastery of the Yellow Rose has served as a gatekeeper between sacred insight and worldly involvement. It has preserved histories, housed miracles, and harbored fugitives of fate. Among its brothers are paladins, scholars, and orphans raised into spiritual purpose.

It is also the place where **Baldric Keenglaive’s pilgrimage began**, chosen not for its grandeur, but for the clarity of its silence. From its highest spire, Kane looked upon Baldric and saw a dawn not yet risen.

---

**Events/Encounters:**  
- **Baldric’s Recognition:** Kane, through prayer and insight, identified Baldric as one who should walk west—not into hiding, but into preparation.  
- **Naming the Path:** It was here that the term *Pilgrimage of the Dawnborne* was first spoken.  
- **Departure:** Brother Gylas was chosen as Baldric’s guardian and guide, under Kane’s blessing.

---

**Spiritual Significance:**  
Though aligned with Ilmater, the Yellow Rose monks believe suffering refines clarity. They saw in Baldric not a savior, but a **witness in the making**—a boy whose trials would not break him, but burnish him into truth.
