**Name:** The Outer Gate of Mithral Halls  
**Region:** Western Silver Marches, near Keeper’s Dale  
**Affiliation:** Citadel Adbar and the Dwarves of Clan Battlehammer

---

**Description:**  
The Outer Gate of Mithral Halls is the western threshold to the ancestral dwarven stronghold. Hewn into the cliffs and fortified by ages of craftsmanship, it guards the passage into the legendary subterranean citadel.

Most times, the gate is unmanned—reliant on hidden wards and its remoteness for protection. But during times of war, it becomes the **first bastion of dwarven resistance**.

It was here, in silence and urgency, that a small detachment of Aster knights and squires led by **Flambard and Baldric Keenglaive** held the line against a drow advance aimed at **Keeper’s Dale**.

---

**Historical Role:**  
- Once collapsed during the first fall of Mithral Halls and rebuilt under Bruenor’s restoration efforts.  
- Site of an unrecorded but valorous stand by the **Order of the Aster**, preventing dark elves from breaching the surface line.

---

**Events/Encounters:**  
- **The Battle of the Gate:** The Aster knights formed a defensive wedge and repelled waves of drow forces.  
- Baldric, discarding shield and sword, wielded his lance with devastating reach, altering the tempo of battle.  
- Though all knights were wounded, none perished. Their tenacity preserved the gates from a surface breach.

**Spiritual/Military Significance:**  
To dwarves of the Halls, this battle reinforced their trust in **surface-world allies**—and marked Baldric and Flambard as **oath-worthy defenders of tradition**.

The gate remains unmarked by monument, but for those who know the tale, it is considered **sacred stone**.
