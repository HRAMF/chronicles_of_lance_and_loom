**Name:** Pilgrimage of the Dawnborne  
**Theme:** Divine Preparation, Child of Destiny, Sacred Becoming

---

**Origin:**  
The Pilgrimage of the Dawnborne refers to the divinely guided path taken by **Baldric Keenglaive** as a child. Rather than being hidden or isolated, Baldric was sent westward from Damara under the guidance of Brother Gylas—an act not of retreat, but of sacred cultivation.

Coined by **Kane of the Yellow Rose**, the phrase reframed Baldric’s departure as an ascent, a journey of inner tempering rather than exile. It is now used by monks and sages alike to describe the emergence of divine potential through lived experience, especially among celestial-blooded children.

**Expression in the World:**  
- The phrase *“Dawnborne”* now refers to individuals marked by celestial inheritance and sacred purpose whose paths are shaped by pilgrimage.  
- In Ilmateri and Lathanderite circles, the pilgrimage has become a model for **divine patience**—letting potential ripen through challenge and context.  
- The path is emulated in bardic tales and aspirant traditions from **Damara to Silverymoon**.

**Outcome & Legacy:**  
The pilgrimage forged Baldric’s spiritual identity. From the steppes of Damara to the sanctuaries of the Sword Coast, each temple, monk, and rite refined rather than redefined him. It was not meant to create faith, but to **unfold what already was**.

Some now say the Dawnborne do not follow prophecy—they generate it.
