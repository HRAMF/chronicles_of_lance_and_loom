**Name:** Gifting of the Dawn Aegis  
**Theme:** Sacred Craft, Earned Worthiness, Promise Forged in Metal

**Origin:**  
In the quiet aftermath of the **Battle at the Mithral Gate**, the dwarves of Mithral Halls offered sanctuary to the battered knights of the Aster. Among them was **Thoradin Anvilsong**, a forge-soul haunted by a divine note he’d heard in freefall, just before **Baldric Keenglaive** had saved his life.

Thoradin did not interpret the rescue as chance, but as **divine invitation**. He began to forge something—not as gift, but as answer. What emerged was the **Dawn Aegis**: a set of plate armor that bore not just function, but *vow*. It was tempered in sacred forges, etched with dwarven prayer, and blessed beneath sunrise.

**Ceremony and Meaning:**  
The armor was given not in spectacle, but **in silence**—before Flambard, Bruenor’s honor guard, and no fanfare. Thoradin spoke only these words: *“This is not reward. It is reflection.”*

The moment marked a transition in Baldric’s journey—from youth of light to **bearer of myth**. Within the armor, Thoradin placed the schematic for **Coronatta**, a symbol of a future not yet written.

**Legacy:**  
- The event is remembered quietly in dwarven smith-prayers, known as the *Moment of the Mirror Flame*.  
- Among Lathanderites, it is considered one of the few modern instances of **divine resonance answered by mortal hands**.  
- For Baldric, it represents more than armor—it is the moment he was first **seen, understood, and trusted with a future greater than command.**
