**Name:** Everlund  
**Region:** Silver Marches, Northwest Faerûn  
**Affiliation:** League of the Silver Marches; neutral-to-good aligned city-state  
**Known For:** The Moongleam Tower, merchant guilds, defensive stonework, and Armathor influence

---

**Description:**  
Set along the banks of the Rauvin River and ringed with stout walls and fortified bridges, Everlund is a city of disciplined order and civil pragmatism. Its guard towers glint with dwarven steel and elven geometry, and its streets run straight—a contrast to the arcane tangle of Silverymoon.

It is a city that has endured. And because it has endured, it clings to rules, alliances, and oaths with iron.

---

**Historical Role:**  
Everlund is a strategic waypoint between Silverymoon, Sundabar, and the outer high passes. During the Silver Marches alliance, it stood as a bulwark against the orcs of the Spine and the ambitions of independent adventuring bands who might threaten the fragile peace.

For the faithful, it is a **testing place**—a city where relics are catalogued, temples are monitored, and **purpose is weighed against procedure**.

---

**Events or Encounters:**  
- **Baldric’s Arrival:** Tasked with overseeing the transport and brief exhibition of relics from Waterdeep to Silverymoon, Baldric first stops in Everlund.  
- **Civic Friction:** Here he observes the friction between Everlund's bureaucratic clergy and the spirit-led paladins he respects.  
- **Threshold Moment:** It is in Everlund that Baldric first senses the limits of institutional faith—the beginning of his quiet suspicion that order and justice are not always synonymous.

---

**Spiritual Significance:**  
Everlund offers **no revelations**—only thresholds. It is a city that holds a mirror up to conviction and asks whether one will keep walking. For Baldric, it was a city passed through—but not forgotten.
