**Role in Narrative:**  
This unnamed champion serves as the silent representative of the **Dusk Riders**—a mounted order of mysterious agents seen only riding at twilight across the Bloodstone Lands. Their presence is not sanctioned by any known polity, yet no guards hinder their passage, and no noble house dares demand explanation.

When Baldric returns to Tellerth, it is this rider he sees at the column’s head—armor dull with road-grime, helm hornless, cloak bearing no sigil. He meets Baldric’s gaze once. Then rides on.

**Personality and Voice:**  
- No voice is heard  
- Carries themselves with precision and ritual grace  
- The air around them is quiet—not threatening, but *observing*  
- What they see, they carry. What they know, they do not share

---

**Key Moments with Baldric:**  
- On the road beyond Tellerth, Baldric stands at attention as the Dusk Riders pass  
- The champion returns his gaze, subtly acknowledging Baldric’s bearing—but not his authority  
- No salute. No bow. No threat. Only recognition

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
This figure represents **sovereignty unspoken**—a challenge not of weapons, but of **mythic weight**. To Baldric, the encounter becomes a quiet litmus of power: these are men who **do not answer to him**, nor to his father’s house.

Their existence becomes a question: *Do they answer to anything at all?*
