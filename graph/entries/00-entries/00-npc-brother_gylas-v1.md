Description:
Brother Gylas is a quiet-hearted monk of Lathander whose strength lies not in might, but in his gentleness. Worn sandals, well-mended robes, and a satchel filled with bread, books, and balm—these are his symbols. Gylas believes deeply that renewal begins with compassion, and that true light must be lived, not preached.

He is rarely still, having spent most of his life walking the roads between temples, aiding villages, and raising orphans into acolytes. His presence radiates warmth without grandeur.

Narrative Significance:
Where Flambard is Baldric’s forge, Gylas is his root. In moments of doubt or sorrow, Baldric often recalls Gylas’ patience, kindness, and open palm. While Gylas rarely appears directly in dreams or memory, his influence colors the very structure of Baldric’s myth.
