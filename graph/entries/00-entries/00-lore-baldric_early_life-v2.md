**Name:** Baldric Keenglaive  
**Focus:** Childhood, Divine Emergence, and Formative Roots  
**Timeframe:** 1344–1357 DR

---

**Summary:**  
Baldric Keenglaive was born into a world straddling ruin and restoration. His earliest years unfolded in the waning terror of Zheng-Yi’s rise, within the rugged fields of Polten—lands tilled by devout farmers turned warriors, the Keenglaives. From the moment his golden eyes caught dawnlight, it was clear that something luminous stirred within him.

While others saw a symbol of hope, his father, **Wycbuhr Keenglaive**, saw risk. Fearful that the Witch-King’s agents might sense Baldric’s divine inheritance, Wycbuhr sent the boy west at age 7, entrusting him to **Brother Gylas** under the guidance of **Kane of the Yellow Rose**. So began Baldric’s myth—on roads of exile, in silence and sun, in love and light.

---

**Keenglaive Legacy:**  
The Keenglaives were no idle nobles. Before elevation, they were farmers and defenders—known for their disciplined **polearm tradition** and early Lathanderite faith, rare in Damara. In the **Battle of Goliad**, Sygeweard the Elder and his kin held the retreating line, earning them the Barony of Polten.

Baldric was raised amid this legacy: martial, humble, and fiercely devout.

**Formative Years (Ages 7–13):**

**Monastery of the Sun (Waterdeep):**  
- Baldric’s **first true sanctuary**, home to warmth, discipline, and celestial stillness  
- Mentored by **Brother Gylas**, nurtured by **Hanor Kichavo**, and surrounded by aspirants of the Order of the Sun Soul  
- Practiced the Keenglaive polearm forms in the **Dawn Yard**, often seen laughing in morning light with staff in hand  
- First experienced **dreams of Elysium** and fleeting contact with **Auréalis**, a Solar of Valor

**Spires of the Morning (Waterdeep):**  
- Attended **masses and theological lessons** with the Church of Lathander’s hierarchy  
- Introduced to **the Order of the Aster**; trained in lancework at the **Lanceyard**  
- Began to sense his dual calling: between sacred ritual and living myth

---

**Spiritual Emergence:**  
By age 11, it became clear that Baldric’s soul **channeled divine magic directly**. Not through prayers—but through presence, clarity, and resonance. Brother Gylas recognized this and facilitated his introduction to **Cyrus Flambard** of the Order of the Aster.

---

**Family Bonds & Tensions:**  
Though Baldric’s exile was framed as a pilgrimage, it was born of **Wycbuhr’s protectiveness and vision**. The two remained spiritually entwined—Wycbuhr expecting a return to secular legacy; Baldric growing into a symbol of something more.

---

**Key Figures:**  
- **Wycbuhr Keenglaive** – Father, founder of Polten’s military tradition, seeks unity of legacy  
- **Brother Gylas** – First guide and emotional anchor  
- **Hanor Kichavo** – Solar master of martial stillness  
- **Cyrus Flambard** – Hammer of doctrine and knightly order  
- **Auréalis** – Dream-mentor, celestial voice of Valor

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
This period defines Baldric’s **root system**—a tangle of obligation, devotion, fear, and longing. It is where his light was first kindled, not in triumph, but in tenderness. His myth does not begin with war, but with love chosen over legacy, and the silent promise of a vow not yet spoken.
