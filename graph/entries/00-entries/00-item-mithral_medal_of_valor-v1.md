**Name:** Mithral Medal of Valor  
**Item Type:** Symbolic Relic (Non-magical)  
**Forged by:** Dwarves of Mithral Halls, Clan Battlehammer

---

**Description:**  
A finely wrought medal forged of pure mithral, etched with the twin sigils of **Clan Battlehammer** and the **Order of the Aster**. Its edges are filigreed with dwarven script that reads: *“To the Shield that Rose”*. Each medal is backed with a gold pin, meant to be worn over the heart.

The medal is not enchanted, but to those who know its origin, it **commands silence and respect**.

---

**Origin:**  
Bestowed by **King Bruenor Battlehammer** himself in the aftermath of the **Battle at the Mithral Gate**. It was given to each surviving member of the Aster detachment that held the outer gate against drow forces.

---

**Bearer History:**  
- **Baldric Keenglaive**: Wore it during his formal investiture into the Aster and kept it tucked inside his field cloak thereafter.  
- **Cyrus Flambard**: Rumored to have passed his medal on to a dying squire during the campaign in Vaasa.

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
This medal is not a reward—but a remembrance. It symbolizes **defiance in the face of darkness**, and the **cost of standing firm when others flee**.

It is whispered that Bruenor’s choice to bestow it upon surface knights marked a turning point in dwarven alliances, and in Baldric’s myth.
