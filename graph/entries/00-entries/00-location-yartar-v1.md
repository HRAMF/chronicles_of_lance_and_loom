**Name:** Yartar  
**Region:** Dessarin Valley, Northwest Faerûn  
**Affiliation:** Independent city-state; member of the Lords’ Alliance  
**Known For:** Bridge city of trade and espionage; home to noble intrigue, mercenary companies, and the Hand of Yartar (thieves’ guild)

---

**Description:**  
Straddling the Dessarin River with mirrored halves, Yartar is a city of crossings—both literal and ideological. Barges pass beneath its stone bridges while ambitions and secrets pass over them. Nobles parade, spies whisper, and coin passes like water.

Here, temples are outposts. Soldiers are mercenaries. And morality is negotiable.

---

**Historical Role:**  
As a hub of the Lords’ Alliance, Yartar is a strategic and often unstable node of influence. It’s been a haven for adventurers, a den for thieves, and a waypoint for priests seeking visibility. Its banners flutter not with ideals—but with negotiation.

**Events or Encounters:**  
- **A Hunt Among Diplomats:** Baldric arrives as part of a ceremonial exchange—a knight among merchants. He is asked to lead a **hunt for ogres** disrupting trade routes east of town.  
- **Reluctant Spectacle:** While intended as a show of force and spectacle for foreign nobles, Baldric senses the hunt’s true nature: **not justice, but theater.**  
- **Path to Tartar:** The expedition departs from Yartar’s eastern quarter, joined by sellswords and war-priests whose allegiance seems more political than divine.

---

**Spiritual Significance:**  
Yartar was the first city that asked Baldric to **become a symbol on command**—not for faith, but for agenda. His decision to participate in the ogre hunt marks a tension between duty and discomfort that echoes throughout his return journey.
