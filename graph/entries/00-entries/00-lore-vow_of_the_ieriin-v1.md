**Name:** Vow of the Ieriyn  
**Theme:** Celestial devotion, presence, balance through love  
**Timeframe:** Spoken during the Wedding at Waltzing Dale, Spring of 1366 DR

---

**Context:**  
This vow was spoken by **Calanthe Forgecrown**, the Starweaver, known in celestial myth as **the Ieriyn**—the guiding star, the dream that does not fade.  
It was given upon still waters, in harmony with the dawn, at the height of her convergence with Baldric Keenglaive, the Heaven’s Strength.

The vow is not a promise of possession. It is a vow of **recognition**, of attunement, of choosing presence again and again across all seasons.

**The Vow:**  
> “I knew you before I met you.  
> In the hush between constellations, I saw a light that did not rise to blind—but to call.  
> I followed it. And there you stood.  
> Not as fire—but as horizon. Not as conqueror—but as dawn made tender.

> Where I am wildness, you are rhythm.  
> Where I am rooted in stars, you rise in truth.  
> You never reached for me to tame. You saw me, and did not flinch.  
> And so I vow:

> To never ask you to slow.  
> To never let you drift alone.  
> To meet your flame not with shadow—but with bloom.

> I vow to make joy a habit.  
> I vow to listen when your silence says what your lips will not.  
> I vow to remind you that valor can rest—that duty can dance.

> I do not promise safety.  
> I promise presence.  
> And wherever your path points—mine will shape the wind beneath it.

> Baldric…  
> My light. My anchor. My clarity."
