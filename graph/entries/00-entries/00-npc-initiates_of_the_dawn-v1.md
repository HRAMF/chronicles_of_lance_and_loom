**Name:** Initiates of the Dawn  
**Classification:** NPC Ensemble  
**Affiliation:** Monastery of the Sun, Order of the Sun Soul  
**Region:** Waterdeep (Eastern Outskirts)

**Description:**  
The Initiates of the Dawn are the aspirants, orphans, and vision-marked youths who form the youngest circle of discipline at the **Monastery of the Sun**. They rise before light, train before breakfast, and pray not with words—but with stillness, breath, and radiant repetition.

They are taught **not to shine** but to **receive the light without ego**, learning to channel divinity as flow, not force. They share dormitories, sparring rings, meditation cloisters, and fireless song rituals. Most arrive with nothing but a name. They leave with posture, clarity, and soul-anchored memory.

**Role in Baldric’s Story:**  
During his formative years, Baldric lived, laughed, and trained alongside these fellow aspirants. Though he would one day rise beyond them, he never outgrew them. They were his siblings in rhythm, his mirrors in sunrise discipline.

Among them were:  
- **Lhoel of the Shimmerpond**, who saw the world in color-sound  
- **Sereta Brightcliff**, a stoic weaver of devotional poems  
- **Toman Rivet-hand**, who could not stop fidgeting, and thus learned stillness with greater reverence than most

Though none became knights or saints, many became **quiet lights**—practitioners, herbalists, scribes, and emissaries of calm throughout Faerûn.

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
They are the **unsung roots beneath Baldric’s foundation**. He never named them in speeches, but their voices echo in his pauses. Their small laughter lives in his silences. When he kneels, it is in rhythms learned with them.
