**Narrative:**  
Their love was not born in fire or prophecy.

It was shaped in **resonance**.

Where he walked like dawn, radiant and silent, she met him like starlight—constant, deep, and quietly miraculous.  
**Baldric**, the Heaven’s Strength, known across song and legend as *the Peregrine of the Dawn*.  
**Calanthe**, the night’s gaze made warm, now known as *the Ieriyn*, the Sailor’s Star.

Together, they were not opposites.  
They were **navigation**.

To follow the other is to remember **why** you rise.
