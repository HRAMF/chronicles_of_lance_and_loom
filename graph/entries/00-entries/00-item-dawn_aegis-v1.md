**Name:** Dawn Aegis  
**Item Type:** Custom Plate Armor (Masterwork)  
**Forged by:** Thoradin Anvilsong, Forge-Soul of Mithral Halls

---

**Description:**  
A suit of radiant plate crafted from **mithral alloy**, **sun-tempered bronze**, and runes blessed in the forge-temples of Mithral Halls. Its surface gleams with a faint golden luster, especially in the morning light. On the cuirass is etched a stylized rising sun held within a dwarven knot—a mark of both **Lathander** and **Clan Battlehammer**.

Beneath the pauldrons, the inner plates are layered with thin segments of **dawnleaf**—a rare foil-like weave known for dampening necrotic energies.

Though not enchanted by spell, the armor is considered **sacred**. It is worn not as defense, but as **affirmation**.

---

**Properties and Powers:**  
- Treated as **mithral full plate** (no STR requirement, no stealth disadvantage)  
- Provides resistance to ambient radiant damage (narrative effect)  
- Counts as a holy symbol of Lathander while worn  
- Bears a hidden scroll-tube in the breastplate containing a dwarven schematic (Coronatta)

---

**Lore/Origin:**  
Crafted by **Thoradin Anvilsong** after Baldric saved his life during a tremor in the Halls. Thoradin, haunted by the divine melody he heard during the rescue, believed Baldric's survival and arrival were part of a **celestial pattern**.

He forged the Dawn Aegis over weeks of prayer, smithing, and memory. The schematic within—**Coronatta**—is a future weapon he believes Baldric will one day be ready to receive, when “the sun demands its root.”

---

**Bearer History:**  
- Forged exclusively for **Baldric Keenglaive**.  
- Received in a private gifting ritual attended only by Flambard, Thoradin, and the silent guard of Mithral Halls.

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
The Dawn Aegis is not just armor—it is a **vow in metal**, a testament that courage begets recognition not through fame, but through quiet witness.

It became Baldric’s defining emblem, donned during battles, rites, and oaths. To Lathanderites and dwarves alike, it symbolizes **earned sanctity**.
