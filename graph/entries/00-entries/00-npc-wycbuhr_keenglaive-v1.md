**Description:**  
Wycbuhr Keenglaive is a man forged in frost and fire—a war-scarred veteran whose pride is measured not in gold or title, but in the preservation of his line and land. Once a farmer-general in the shadow of the Witch-King, Wycbuhr rose through valor, leading Polten’s flank at the Battle of Goliad. His nobility is hard-earned, his legacy carefully built.

He dresses plainly, favors calloused words over ceremony, and rarely shows emotion—except in the quiet reverence he holds for duty.

**Role in Baldric’s Story:**  
Wycbuhr is both **Baldric’s protector and pressure point**. He once hid his son’s divine nature out of love and fear, sending him west to shield him from the Witch-King’s grasp. Now, with the land in peril again, and Baldric returned, he expects his heir to **fully embrace the mantle of Warden**.

Though proud of Baldric’s deeds, Wycbuhr remains frustrated that his son’s heart remains divided—**part ruler, part myth**, loyal to Lathander’s call as much as to Polten’s soil.

- Arranged Baldric’s exile at age 7 through counsel with Kane, Dugald, and Gareth Dragonsbane  
- Welcomed his son’s return as de facto Warden of Polten with cautious satisfaction  
- Pressures Baldric to relinquish sacred oaths and become **Baron in title as well as deed**

---

**Personality:**  
- Stalwart, dutiful, and quietly commanding  
- Skeptical of divine mysticism and “romantic legends”  
- Measures love in protection and legacy—not in softness

---

**Notable Traits & Actions:**  
- Founder of modern Polten military tradition, rooted in Keenglaive polearm drills  
- Holds quiet disdain for distant clergy or southern reformers  
- Deeply loyal to King Gareth, but increasingly wary of Helgabal’s inner court

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Wycbuhr is **Baldric’s most personal foil**—the weight of secular responsibility and familial expectation. While Baldric walks the Third Path between mortal and mythic, Wycbuhr demands a return to earth, to governance, to permanence.

He is a man who gave everything to build a future—and now sees that future walking a path he cannot follow.
