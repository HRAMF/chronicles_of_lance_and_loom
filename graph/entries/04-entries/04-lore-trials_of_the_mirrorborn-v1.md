**Description:**  
These trials are myth-structured constructs formed within a mirror-node, designed to test not the physical prowess of intruders but their memory, identity, and conviction. They form a rite of passage for those confronting false narratives, particularly individuals whose legacies are being co-opted or rewritten by mythic forces.

Each trial is presented through symbolic constructs (pillars, echoes, visions) and represents a different axis of internal conflict. Completion is required to reclaim truth—either one's own or another's.

**The Three Trials:**  
- **Steel** — A test of strength and resolve, confronting a mirrored version of oneself shaped by fear or failure  
- **Flame** — A trial of memory and guilt, forcing the bearer to recall not heroism, but honest grief  
- **Sacrifice** — A final test requiring the surrender of something precious: a truth, a hope, or a symbol
