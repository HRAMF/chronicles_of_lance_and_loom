**Name:** Restoration of Priscilla  
**Category:** Myth-Rescue / Identity Reclamation  
**Event Type:** Consequence of Mirrorborn Trial Completion  
**Resolved By:** Baldric Keenglaive and Calanthe Forgecrown  

---

**Description:**  
During the Trials of the Mirrorborn, Baldric and Calanthe discovered that Priscilla’s essence had been ensnared within a mirror-echo construct—her memories fractured and rewritten to serve a mythically false narrative. Her soul was not destroyed, but miscast: forced to perform a version of herself that glorified sacrifice over truth, and diminished joy in favor of tragedy.  

By passing the three symbolic trials—Steel, Flame, and Sacrifice—and invoking the truth of their shared bond, Baldric and Calanthe shattered the narrative hold over her. Through grief, memory, and love, they reasserted the real Priscilla.

**Stages of Restoration:**  
1. **Recognition:** Calanthe identifies the echo’s narrative recursion and emotional fissures  
2. **Confrontation:** Baldric resists the imposed myth and reclaims Priscilla’s name with the Blooming Vow as anchor  
3. **Dissonance Collapse:** The false narrative unravels, and the mirror echo disintegrates  
4. **Reintegration:** Priscilla’s true self reconstitutes with the memory of her entrapment intact

**Residual Effects:**  
- Priscilla retains fragments of the echo’s experiences and phrasing  
- She is now myth-sensitive and may serve as a living anchor or conduit  
- Her songs may influence how others remember or resist mythic distortion  

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
This event demonstrates that myth-corrupted souls can be redeemed—not merely exorcised, but re-integrated. Priscilla’s restoration becomes a symbol of resistance and hope, showing that stories bent by myth can be straightened, not just burned.
