Session 01 – Prologue: Omens Campaign Title: The Waking Vow: Chronicles of the Blooming Dawn

Date of Session: Earliest narrative thread Setting: Pre-Spring, 1372 DR Primary Location: Waltzing Dale Homestead, Barony of Polten

Summary: The campaign opens with a peaceful and intimate glimpse into the life of Baldric Keenglaive and his wife Calanthe. Together with their children, they have settled into the lush and sacred lands of Waltzing Dale—a place of love, growth, and quiet power.
But Calanthe wakes from a troubling dream, speaking of omens and decay emanating from the borders near Rawlinswood. The balance of nature trembles. Baldric, recognizing the tone and weight of her insight, prays for clarity and listens for guidance from his angelic mentors in Elysium.
A Sending Stone crackles to life—Flambard has sent word. A druid of Calanthe’s circle has been found burned from within, ranting of fractured roots and the return of old corruption. The message marks the first beat of a prophecy unfolding.
Together, Baldric and Calanthe prepare. They send their children to the family estate in Trailsend, summon Invincible, and ready their gear.
