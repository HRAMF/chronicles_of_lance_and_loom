**Alignment:** Neutral Good  
**Background:** Noble of Impiltur  
**Affiliation:** Circle of Leth

**Description:**  
Calanthe is a radiant presence—both grounded and ethereal. Her curls are often adorned with meadowflowers or golden rings, and her eyes hold the shifting hues of hazel and green. By day, she tends to Waltzing Dale with gentle determination; by night, constellations flicker faintly across her skin, echoing the stars that guide her path.

---

**Personality:**  
Compassionate, observant, and deeply intuitive. Calanthe trusts her instincts above all and has an uncanny sense for the natural balance between light and growth, silence and song.

- **Trait:** Listens first, speaks only when her words are needed.  
- **Ideal:** Truth through nature; healing through memory.  
- **Bond:** Her vow with Baldric—the Blooming Vow—is both sacred and metaphysical.  
- **Flaw:** Feels responsible for the fractured state of her Circle and the creeping corruption of the Rawlinswood.

**Narrative Significance:**  
Calanthe is not merely Baldric’s wife, but his equal in purpose. Her insights often serve as the party’s moral compass. The campaign begins and bends around her dream-vision of the burning tree and the draconic ash—foretelling the trials to come. She anchors the Circle of Leth’s spiritual legacy, and her presence sanctifies the lands they reclaim.
