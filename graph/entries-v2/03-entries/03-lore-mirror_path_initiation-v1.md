**Name:** Mirror Path Initiation  
**Category:** Myth-Node Access Rite / Identity Echo Trigger  
**Primary Anchor:** Herondale Mirror (03-relic-herondale_mirror-v1)  
**First Entered By:** Baldric Keenglaive and Calanthe Forgecrown

**Description:**  
The Mirror Path refers to a ritualized form of mythic descent—an entry into the echo-layered subrealities formed by corrupted memory, unresolved emotion, or myth-borne identity recursion. The ritual does not require incantation or arcane keys. Instead, it resonates through **emotion, proximity, and reflective focus**.

Initiation into the Mirror Path occurred for the first time beneath Herondale. Calanthe’s presence, the music box of echoes, and Baldric’s unspoken doubts awakened the node. Upon stepping through the mirror, the pair entered a place not of dreams—but of warped truths.

**Activation Signs (Observed):**  
- The mirror surface shimmered with incomplete memories  
- Nearby objects (music box, sigils) began to echo mismatched timelines  
- Emotions such as grief, guilt, or doubt triggered instability in light and sound  
- Passage required intent, not incantation  

---

**Mythic Consequences:**  
- Echo bleed: Residual feelings from the myth layer may linger  
- Identity Fluctuation: Memory anchors and roles may shift in unreconciled visitors  
- Potential Unravel: Prolonged exposure risks spiritual detachment or mirror fracturing

**Narrative Significance:**  
This is the first full ritual descent into a myth-node by the party. It introduces the campaign’s internal metaphysics: that myth is not merely symbolic—it is structured, invasive, and alive. The Mirror Path becomes a recurring test of truth vs. illusion, memory vs. narrative.
