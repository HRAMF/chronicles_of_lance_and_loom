Narrative & Mechanical Evolution of the Waltzing Dale Wedding Band
Initial Form:
Ring of Protection (+1 to AC and all saving throws)

First Awakening – The Blooming Vow
Triggered by:
The re-consecration of the altar
Their waltz atop sacred ground
The reaffirmation of their vows in shared myth and battle
Transformation Name:
 “Waltzing Vow Ring”
 (Rare, evolving relic, attunement required)
Current Effects:
+1 to AC and Saving Throws (retained from Ring of Protection)
You may add your Charisma modifier to any one Wisdom saving throw once per long rest
When in physical contact with Calanthe, you both regain 1d4 hit points at the end of a short rest (once per rest)

Future Milestone Evolutions – Tied to Love, Growth, and Shared Triumphs
Shared Flight (Mid-Tier)


When both rings are attuned and the two are together, Baldric’s Revelation form may last 1 additional round
Once per long rest, he may activate it without expending a use if Calanthe is in danger
Permanent Manifestation (High-Tier)


Baldric may keep celestial wings manifest (non-flight, aesthetic) as a symbol of his eternal vow
When he chooses, he may regain flight once per long rest for 10 minutes as part of a radiant rebirth
The ring glows when Baldric and Calanthe are in sync emotionally or spiritually

What Baldric Offers Calanthe (Narratively and Mechanically)
His unyielding faith, tempered by humility
His respect for her nature, not seeking to tame or control it
His desire to share leadership, not overshadow
His belief that love is a strength, not a weakness
This might empower Calanthe’s ring in turn:
Empowering healing spells when protecting Baldric
Enhanced nature-based travel when they journey together
Shared resistance or saving throw enhancements in moments of joint danger
