**Description:**  
Once a desecrated node overtaken by myth-echoes and led by a mirror-faced figure, this grove has been reclaimed through sacrifice, unity, and divine love. During a spontaneous ritual—initiated not by incantation but by truth and memory—Baldric and Calanthe renewed the Blooming Vow before a broken altar.

The land responded. Petals bloomed in soil that moments before wept ichor. A sigil of light and vine emerged on the stone, marking the first spontaneous Blooming Vow ward. Beneath it, the **Dawnsteel Root** was revealed—a myth-reactive relic tied to Coronatta’s soul.

**Notable Features:**  
- **Blooming Vow Sigil:** Living glyph formed by consecrated love; resists myth-breach  
- **Dawnsteel Root Chamber:** Hidden beneath the altar, origin point of a relic tier  
- **Warding Bloom:** Faint radiance at dawn, visible to those who carry sacred vows  
- **Aster Encampment Ring:** Outer perimeter established after the grove’s cleansing

**Narrative Significance:**  
This is the first place sanctified not by clerical rites, but by lived truth and emotion. The Grove of the Blooming Vow becomes a symbol of resistance—not only to corruption, but to the idea that myth alone determines what is real. It anchors Baldric and Calanthe’s union in the fabric of the land and gives myth a new reference point: love.
