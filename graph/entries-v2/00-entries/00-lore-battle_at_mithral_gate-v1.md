**Name:** The Battle at the Mithral Gate  
**Theme:** Oathbound Valor, Tactical Sacrifice, Forgotten Heroism

---

**Origin:**  
In 1371 DR, under reports of rising drow activity near Silverymoon, a small detachment of **Order of the Aster** knights was dispatched under **Cyrus Flambard** and his protégé, **Baldric Keenglaive**. Their mission: investigate dark rituals and intercept underdark forces.

What they found was a **drow incursion advancing toward Keeper’s Dale**, with the gates of Mithral Halls left momentarily unguarded. The Aster host—no more than ten knights and squires—formed a bulwark at the gate.

---

**The Battle:**  
- The knights fought in tight formation, resisting wave after wave of drow warriors, shadow-summoners, and blade dancers.  
- **Baldric**, abandoning his sword and shield mid-battle, wielded his lance with reach and momentum, repelling flanking skirmishers.  
- Though the Aster formation broke twice, Flambard’s rallying command and Baldric’s sweeping protection kept them from collapse.

By battle’s end, all were wounded, most unconscious—but **none perished**. Only Flambard and Baldric stood at the end, bruised but unbowed.

---

**Aftermath & Recognition:**  
King **Bruenor Battlehammer**, upon learning of the defense, declared the gate’s preservation a sacred debt. He awarded each knight a **Mithral Medal of Valor** and granted the group access to the Halls for healing and rest.

Dwarven historians later named it a **pyrrhic victory**, and some whisper that Lathander’s light itself shielded the fallen from death.

---

**Legacy:**  
- Became a defining event in Baldric’s legend and his bond with Flambard  
- Echoed through bardic tales sung in Ironspur and Trailsend  
- Commemorated privately by dwarves with a silent toast each year
