**Name:** The Coin Left Unclaimed  
**Theme:** Bribery, moral clarity, resistance without violence  
**Timeframe:** Mid Summer, 1365 DR

---

**Origin:**  
Rumors had whispered along the docks of Daggerford: that the **Mariner’s Alliance** had begun moving more than salted fish along the River Shining.  

While accompanying Flambard on a routine inspection, Baldric noticed the tilt of a barrel and the unnatural ring of metal. Beneath canvas and ice—**weapons**, wrapped for transit. Not for protection. For war. And not for the duchy. For the **Zhentarim**.

---

**Expression in the World:**  
Before he could act, a representative approached him—a man with no name, only a sealed offer: **a magical amulet**, modest in appearance but humming with enchantment. "No need to cause a scene. Just let this one pass."

Baldric smiled. Then **slipped**.

He knocked over crates. Called for help. Drew attention. Not by declaration—but **by disruption**.  

By the time guards arrived, the smuggling crew had nowhere to run. The amulet was gone. Forgotten.

But the moment was not.

---

**Outcome & Legacy:**  
Baldric’s choice not to confront, but to **expose**, became a teaching tool in later years. To his squires, he would say:  
> “You do not always need to strike. Sometimes, it is enough to hold your ground and let the light fall where it must.”

The smuggling ring was broken. Quietly. Without blood.  
The amulet was never traced. But stories of **the paladin who laughed at coin** began to stir in southern ports.
