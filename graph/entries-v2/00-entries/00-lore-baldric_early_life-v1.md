**Name:** Baldric Keenglaive  
**Focus:** Early Life, Family Tradition, and Divine Recognition  
**Timeframe:** 1344–1357 DR

**Summary:**  
Born during the rise of Zheng-Yi the Witch-King of Vaasa, Baldric Keenglaive entered a world already poised between terror and resistance. His family, formerly influential farmers in Polten, were renowned for their rigorous polearm martial tradition and devout Lathanderite roots—a rarity in the Bloodstone Lands.

When Baldric's divine nature began to manifest (most notably in the mornings), his father **Wycbuhr Keenglaive** consulted with King Gareth, Brother Dugald of Ilmater, and Kane of the Monastery of the Yellow Rose. It was **Kane** who, through divinatory insight, steered the boy toward Lathander's path.

At just 7 years old, Baldric was entrusted to **Brother Gylas** of the Order of the Sun Soul, who brought him westward on a sacred pilgrimage to shield him from the Witch-King’s gaze and nurture his calling. This journey would define his soul.

**Major Milestones:**  
- **Keenglaive Legacy:** Descended from **Sygeweard the Elder**, whose heroism during the **Battle of Goliad** in 1357 DR secured the army's left flank and enabled a Damaran retreat. This earned the family the Barony of Polten from King Gareth Dragonsbane.
- **Sanctified Pilgrimage:** Escorted west by Gylas, Baldric journeyed through monasteries and Lathanderite shrines, internalizing the Morninglord's ideals through action and memory.
- **Waterdeep Formation:** Lived in the Monastery of the Sun; studied at the Spires of the Morning; trained among paladins of the Order of the Aster and the Sun Soul.
- **Spiritual Differentiation:** At age 11, Gylas discerned that Baldric's faith was lived through deeds, not prayer, and arranged his transition to the **Order of the Aster**, where **Cyrus Flambard** became his formal martial tutor.
