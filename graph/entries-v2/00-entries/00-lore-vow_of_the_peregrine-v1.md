**Name:** Vow of the Peregrine  
**Theme:** Devotion, clarity, sacred purpose  
**Timeframe:** Spoken during the Wedding at Waltzing Dale, Spring of 1366 DR

---

**Context:**  
This vow was spoken by **Baldric Keenglaive**, the Heaven’s Strength—known in myth as *the Peregrine*.  
Offered beneath the rising sun, across still waters awakened by bloom and starlight, this vow consecrated not possession, but **stewardship**.

To Calanthe, the Ieriyn, he did not swear to guard a heart—but to **walk beside it**, forever attuned.

**The Vow:**  
> “I stood beneath morning light when I first beheld you—not as a vision, but as truth given shape.  
> Where I carried flame, you carried seed.  
> Where I raised walls, you made paths.  
> I am the herald of dawn, and you are the breath that gives it purpose.

> In your laughter, I learned joy could be a form of courage.  
> In your gaze, I saw the sky made fertile.  
> In your silence, I heard the rhythm of old stars.

> I do not vow to protect you—because you are no lesser half.  
> I vow to walk beside you through sun and silence, blossom and ash.  
> I vow to never wield my light to scorch, nor my voice to silence the hum of your wildness.

> Just as the land chose us, I choose you—again and again—with eyes open and soul ablaze.

> Calanthe…  
> My heart. My clarity. My dawn."
