Arran Brightsmile is a radiant and enigmatic figure within the Church of Lathander—part seer, part scholar, and part artist of the Weave.

She is known for her celestial insights and her uncanny ability to detect mythic entanglement within mortal souls.

**Role in Baldric’s Story:**  
Arran was Baldric’s **arcane and spiritual mentor** during his formative years at **Rhyester’s Matins**. She helped him make sense of his divine soul sorcery—not as a mutation or anomaly, but as a **blossoming aspect of Lathander’s will**.

- Guided Baldric in channeling Weave-bound divine energy  
- Interpreted his visions of Elysium and his visitations by Auréalis  
- Reinforced the sanctity of his emotional truth and mythic calling  
- Presided over several rites, including his first self-led sanctification ritual

She taught not in doctrine, but through radiant metaphor, quiet meditation, and harmonized spellcasting.

**Notable Teachings:**  
- “Dawn is not the moment light breaks the dark. It is the moment we choose to open our eyes.”  
- Introduced Baldric to the **Celestial Constellation Meditations**  
- Helped define his use of **divine magic as emotional and intentional architecture**

---

**Personality:**  
- Empathetic, humorous, and profoundly patient  
- Often communicates in gentle riddles or poetic phrasing  
- Believes music and memory are forms of divine invocation

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Arran’s influence defines the **gentle confidence** in Baldric’s spellcraft and the **mythic fluidity** in his ritual thinking. She is a guardian of nuance—one who reminds him that sanctity can be sung as well as sworn.

She may reappear should mythic corruption threaten the sacred memory of Lathander’s most peaceful traditions.
