**Description:**  
Built on the site where a blind prophet once regained sight at dawn, **Rhyester’s Matins** is a glistening sanctuary devoted to Lathander’s revelations and inner transformation. A confluence of radiant glasswork, curved lightwells, and soft acoustics, the Matins is a sanctuary of contemplation, renewal, and visionary learning.

Here, the tenets of the Morninglord are taught as truths both liturgical and lived—rooted not only in devotion, but in healing, sacrifice, and foresight.

**Baldric’s Connection:**  
Rhyester’s Matins was where Baldric’s **higher training as a mythic paladin and divine soul** reached its pivotal refinement. Under the tutelage of:

- **Arran Brightsmile**, high priestess and celestial scholar, Baldric explored the contours of divine magic and learned to harmonize his inner light with the arcane structure of the Weave.
- **Cyrus Flambard**, who accompanied him during this period as a traveling paladin mentor, instilled the rigor of service and tactical acumen in Baldric’s knightly core.

Their contrast sharpened Baldric’s path—**Flambard’s discipline against Arran’s mysticism**, creating the crucible from which Baldric’s *Third Path* began to emerge.

Here, Baldric learned that to lead, he must also listen—to gods, to the land, and to those he loves.
