**Name:** Trailsend  
**Region:** Southern Damara, Barony of Polten  
**Affiliation:** House Keenglaive; trade with Impiltur  
**Known For:** Border markets, pilgrims to the Rawlinswood, southern gate of the realm

---

**Description:**  
Trailsend lies at the crossroads of **faith and drift**. Built near the southern fork of the Merchant’s Run, it welcomes travelers from Impiltur, exiles from the moors, and druids from the Rawlinswood. It is not a fortified city—but a spiritual liminal.

Here, sermons are often held under tents. News spreads before writ. And **prophets are heard before they are challenged**.

---

**Historical Role:**  
Originally a military outpost during the Witch-King wars, Trailsend became a sanctuary for pilgrims and herbalists in peacetime. Its people are open-handed, but suspicious of centralized control—a trait that allowed the **Yellow Sun Preacher** to take root unimpeded.

The town respects the Keenglaive name, but its loyalty leans toward **who heals, not who rules**.

---

**Events or Encounters:**  
- **Adventure #11:** A preacher arrives claiming visions of the “God of the Yellow Sun.”  
- Though at first dismissed, his touch **cures afflictions**, and his words spark unrest.  
- Flambard charges Baldric with silencing the heresy. Baldric **chooses discretion**—watching, debating, and seeking counsel from Wycbuhr.  
- The people do not riot—but they watch closely who dares call their healer a heretic.

---

**Spiritual Significance:**  
Trailsend tests not Baldric’s blade, but his **tongue and conscience**. Here, **proof of power** does not mean truth. It is a place where mercy must walk **hand in hand with authority**—or lose both.
