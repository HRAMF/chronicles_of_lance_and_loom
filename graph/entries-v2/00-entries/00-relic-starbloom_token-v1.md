**Name:** Starbloom Token  
**Category:** Druidic Relic  
**Origin:** Circle of Leth, Waltzing Dale  
**Current Keeper:** Calanthe Forgecrown (The Ieriyn)

---

**Description:**  
A small pendant of **gleaming driftwood**, carved in the shape of a **six-pointed starburst**, with a dried blossom woven through its center. The blossom changes seasonally on its own—never wilting.

The reverse bears no name, only a circular inscription in Sylvan:

> *"When root and starlight speak, we listen."*

---

**Properties:**  
- **Living Resonance:** When held during a seasonal rite, the token glows faintly if the balance of local flora is harmonious.  
- **Shared Rhythm:** Once per long rest, the bearer may cast *Druidcraft* as a silent message—conveying emotion and intention across natural spaces to other Circle members.  
- **Vowwarded Bloom:** If presented during a ritual of trust or union, it temporarily grants advantage to Insight and Persuasion checks related to the land and its stewards.

---

**Symbolism:**  
The Starbloom Token is gifted only to those who **bridge seasonal rhythm with communal stewardship**. Calanthe’s is the first to bear a star motif—marking her as a convergence point between grove and sky.

It is said that when she danced the Waltz atop the Dale, the star-shape bloomed without touch.
