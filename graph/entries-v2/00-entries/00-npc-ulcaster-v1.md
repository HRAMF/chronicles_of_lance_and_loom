*Type: npc-entry*

**Name:** Ulcaster  
**Race:** Human (Deceased)  
**Class:** Archmage (Evocation, formerly)  
**Type:** Ghost  
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral (bound by oath and grief)  
**Affiliation:** Founder of the Ulcaster School of Magic (now ruined)

---

**Role in Narrative:**  
Ulcaster is a lingering spirit—bound not by hatred, but by unfinished duty. Though he once ruled over a respected academy of magic, he was unable to prevent its downfall. His soul now lingers within the shattered vaults of Beregost’s outskirts, seeking not peace—but *rectification*.

He petitions Baldric not with wrath, but **with sorrow**. Necromantic desecration of his school has disturbed what little dignity remains. He suspects former lovers—**Arkion and Nemphre**—of exploiting his school's legacy.

---

**Personality and Voice:**  
- Regal yet weary  
- Speaks in measured tones, often in riddles or verses  
- Still clings to the ethics of academic mentorship  
- Mournful of how power without humility consumed his life's work

---

**Key Moments with Baldric:**  
- Appears at twilight, drifting into the temple courtyard rather than rising from the grave  
- Identifies signs of arcane tampering—namely **memory-fused jewelry**, left as "keys" between lovers  
- Entrusts Baldric not with vengeance—but **discernment**, asking: *“Judge the living not for what they touch—but for why they reach.”*

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Ulcaster embodies the **legacy of knowledge misused**, and the cost of oversight. He is not a villain, nor a victim—but a guardian of memory who entrusts Baldric with the **burial of misuse**, not the elevation of judgment.
