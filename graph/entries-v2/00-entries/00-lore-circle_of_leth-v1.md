**Name:** Circle of Leth  
**Theme:** Seasonal rhythm, balance through stewardship, protective grace  
**Timeframe:** Active for centuries prior to 1366 DR; renewed influence with Calanthe's arrival

---

**Overview:**  
The **Circle of Leth** is a druidic order native to **Damara**, named after the ancient Lethwood (now partially absorbed by Rawlinswood).  
They are guardians of seasonal harmony—not in preservation of wilderness alone, but in the **relationship between land and life**.

Unlike some circles who resist settlement outright, the Circle of Leth teaches *coexistence through awareness*. Their gifts are not in fire and claw—but in pruning, planting, and **knowing when to yield**.

---

**Doctrine and Practice:**  
- The Circle moves with **seasonal intention**: four conclaves meet and shift their rites as the year turns.  
- They recognize the rhythms of civilization, seeking not to halt progress, but **to steer it back to breath**.  
- Their rites often incorporate **shared tending**: farmers, woodcutters, and pilgrims may be invited into seasonal offerings.

They believe every overreach begins with forgetting the land listens.

---

**Known Roles Within the Circle:**  
- **Verdants** – Senior druids who oversee one of the four seasonal enclaves  
- **Tenders** – Roving druids who serve towns and forest paths alike  
- **Voices of the Grove** – Rare emissaries who act as counsel to secular leaders  

Each member carries a seasonally carved token, often exchanged during rites of passage or union.

**Calanthe’s Influence:**  
When **Calanthe Forgecrown** arrived in Damara, she was not seeking a circle.  
But when the land recognized her voice, so did the druids.

They did not give her rank.  
They gave her **silence to tend**—and watched what she planted.

Her presence shifted the Circle’s posture toward renewal. With her, they remembered that guidance could be joyful, not only solemn.

They named her *The Guiding Star*.  
She led them not by power, but by course correction.

---

**Legacy:**  
The Circle of Leth now holds seasonal rites at the **Waltzing Dale**, and young druids journey from afar to witness the orchard that blooms against the frost.

Many attribute the resurgence of wildflowers in western Rawlinswood to Calanthe’s alignment with the land—and the way the Circle learned to *listen again*.

**Closing Thought:**  
> Where others drew borders, they planted rhythm.  
> Where others resisted the future, they chose to shape it.
