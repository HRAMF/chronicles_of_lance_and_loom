**Name:** Coronatta Schematic  
**Item Type:** Conceptual Artifact Design (Future Relic)  
**Inscribed by:** Thoradin Anvilsong  
**Material Form:** Scroll-tube hidden within the Dawn Aegis breastplate

---

**Description:**  
A tightly rolled dwarven vellum scroll, etched in blacksteel ink, depicting the structure of a two-stage relic: part weapon, part root. The diagrams are highly symbolic, merging the silhouettes of **spear, lance, and seed** into a single design.

The schematic contains layered notes, fragments of prophecy, and mathematical chant-notation—details no mortal could fully interpret without divine intuition.

---

**Origin:**  
Following the forging of the **Dawn Aegis**, Thoradin was beset by dreams and echoes of a deeper design. He did not understand it—only that it must be recorded. He hid the scroll in a secret groove within Baldric’s armor.

He told Baldric: “This isn’t a weapon you wield. It’s one you become ready for. And one day… you will.”

---

**Properties and Powers:**  
- The schematic is **non-magical**, but **mystically catalytic**—a convergence of inspiration, fate, and sacred geometry.  
- Bears runes indicating a **future calling**, not a present one.  
- Serves as the **seed-concept** of **Coronatta**, a relic not yet forged.

---

**Narrative Role:**  
The schematic is not a blueprint—it is a **promise in waiting**. Just as the Dawn Aegis was forged in gratitude, **Coronatta waits to be forged in truth**.

Whether Baldric will commission it, discover it, or draw it forth from myth remains unknown.
