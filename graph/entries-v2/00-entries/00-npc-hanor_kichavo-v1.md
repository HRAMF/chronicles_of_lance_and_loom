Name: Hanor Kichavo
Race: Human
Class: Monk (Way of the Sun Soul)
Alignment: Lawful Good
Title: Grandmaster of the Order of the Sun Soul
Residence: Monastery of the Sun, Waterdeep


---

Description:
Hanor Kichavo is the venerable and radiant master of the Monastery of the Sun in Waterdeep. An ascetic of deep insight and graceful power, he embodies the spiritual harmony at the heart of the Order of the Sun Soul. His presence is at once humbling and illuminating; he is known to silence whole training grounds simply by entering them, not through authority, but by presence.

Clad in saffron and gold, Kichavo moves as if in constant dialogue with light. Though rarely stern, he commands immense respect. His words are sparse, his wisdom endless.

Role in Baldric’s Story:
Hanor served as a spiritual and philosophical anchor during Baldric’s early training at the Monastery of the Sun. Though not his daily instructor, Kichavo offered pivotal guidance at turning points in Baldric’s development:

Confirmed Baldric’s divine nature upon arrival and supported his transition into Lathanderite tutelage

Gifted Baldric a sunburst-shaped topaz, that would be set into the relic Coronatta
Impressed upon him the ideal that light should never humiliate darkness, only reveal the path back to morning



---

Notable Teachings:

“The sun does not force the flower to bloom. It merely shines until it does.”

Emphasized patience, balance, and the fusion of action with stillness

Encouraged Baldric to listen for meaning not just in scripture—but in silence



---

Narrative Significance:
Hanor is not just a master—he is a mythic reference in Baldric’s inner world. His teachings echo in Baldric’s moments of restraint, mercy, and illumination. Should Baldric return to Waterdeep or seek celestial counsel, Hanor’s wisdom remains a source of quiet revelation.
