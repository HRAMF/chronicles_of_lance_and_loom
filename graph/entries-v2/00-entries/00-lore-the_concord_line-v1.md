**Name:** The Concord Line  
**Theme:** Resonance, unity, sacred geometry  
**Timeframe:** Spring of 1366 DR, crystallized during the Wedding at Waltzing Dale

---

**Origin:**  
The leyline now known as **The Concord Line** was not carved, summoned, or imposed.  
It was *heard*—a subtle hum beneath the world, awakened when two souls stepped into harmony.  

When **Baldric Keenglaive** and **Calanthe Forgecrown** exchanged vows atop the still waters of the Waltzing Dale, something beneath the land stirred.  
Not in protest.  
In resonance.

**Expression in the World:**  
Unlike other leylines, the Concord Line is not a single bolt of energy—it is a **chord**, formed by the harmonic interplay of:

- **Baldric’s celestial nature** (The Heavens’ Strength)  
- **Calanthe’s star-bound rhythm** (The Starweaver)  
- **The land’s latent pattern**, which responded to their convergence  

Together, they formed a triadic bond—**heaven, sky, and earth**—and the land itself bore fruit in reply.  
The spring deepened. The vines bloomed out of season. The stillness of the Dale was broken not by force—but by **trust made whole**.

---

**Magical and Symbolic Properties:**  
- The Concord Line is a leyline of **synthesis**, enhancing spells and rituals that involve unity, healing, oaths, or shared purpose.  
- It resists magic born from division, domination, or exploitation of natural balance.  
- It may serve as an anchor for future sanctuaries, artifacts, or druidic rites tied to balance and renewal.

**Mythic Significance:**  
The Concord Line stands as more than arcane geometry—it is a **memory within the Weave** of what can happen when love does not claim, but honors.

It is the quiet miracle of a lance raised not in war, but in rhythm.  
Of a waltz danced upon still water.  
Of starlight held without trembling.
