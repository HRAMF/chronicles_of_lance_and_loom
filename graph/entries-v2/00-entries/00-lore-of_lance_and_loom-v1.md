**Narrator’s Note:**  
I was there.

I wrote verses about kings and fire, but this was something quieter. Something that sang without needing to be sung. I was not their storyteller—I was only the one who watched closely enough to remember what the land itself did not forget.

— *Priscilla Callonetta*

**The Wedding at Waltzing Dale:**  
There were no bells.

There was no archway, no herald, no sovereign seal.  
Only water. Only morning. Only stillness so profound it made the wind second-guess itself.

They stood where the grass met the pond—a spring-fed hollow they had cleared with their own hands, named with their own breath. *The Waltzing Dale.*

The white stag arrived first.

It bowed once, then vanished into mist.  
That’s when she came.

**Calanthe.**  
Hair like honey drawn through starlight, gown of embroidered root and constellations. Her eyes did not seek approval—they simply *saw*. She walked barefoot, not as defiance, but as invitation.

Then he.

**Baldric.**  
Still as a sunrise, armored in silence, his lance planted into the earth like a banner that did not need declaring. His presence was not forceful—but entire.

And then—without cue—they danced.

Upon the water.

---

**Of the Dance:**  
Not a performance. Not a rite.

A rhythm.

A weaving.

Their steps said more than names ever could. Her laughter circled him like orbit. His stillness held her joy without grasping.

They were opposites only from a distance. Up close, they were **harmony**.

And when the time came for their vows, they did not raise their voices.

They lowered them.

They spoke not to the sky or the onlookers, but to each other—*and the pond held.*

---

**What I Remember Most:**  
The silence afterward.  
The birds waited. The breeze waited. Even the shadows beneath the reeds waited.

And then, as if the Weave itself exhaled—petals bloomed in places we had not planted them.

The land did not bow.  
It leaned in, *as we all did.*

---

**Closing Words:**  
They left no seal. No parchment. No choir.

Only the memory of how two truths can meet and remain whole.

*The Lance did not pierce. The Loom did not bind.  
They moved together—and the world remembered how to follow.*
