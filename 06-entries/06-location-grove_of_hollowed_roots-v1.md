**Name:** Grove of Hollowed Roots  
**Region:** Surface level of Dun-Tharos, above the deeper myth-engine vaults

**Description:**  
A decaying forest glade sunk into a depression of gnarled roots and brittle soil. Once sacred, it became a holding site for corrupted druids under the influence of the Rotting Man. Hollowed-out trees form both shelter and prison. Since its reclamation, it serves as the forward base for the Aster campaign in Dun-Tharos.
