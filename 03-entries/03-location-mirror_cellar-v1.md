**Description:**  
A stone-walled, narrow cellar hidden beneath the inn at Herondale, accessible only through a concealed trapdoor masked with simple illusions. Inside, reality frays. Candles flicker in reverse. The air hums with a pulse not tied to time. In the center stands a grand silver-rimmed mirror framed with thorn-etched vines—an echo anchor.

Instruments of ritual lay scattered: a music box that plays a forgotten melody, scattered tokens of identity, and a circle of runes that glow faintly when touched by divine or druidic presence.

**Notable Features:**  
- **The Herondale Mirror:** Portal and myth-node interface  
- **Runic Circle of Echoes:** Used to channel identity and memory  
- **Music Box of Echoes:** Object linked to memory bleed and recursive loops  
- **Emotion-Resonant Atmosphere:** Amplifies doubt, loss, and longing

**Narrative Significance:**  
This is the first known myth-node the party enters. It marks the beginning of their confrontation with the myth-engine network beneath Dun-Tharos. The distorted memories and rituals encountered here reveal myth’s power to rewrite identity and truth. It also foreshadows the corruption of other sacred places.
