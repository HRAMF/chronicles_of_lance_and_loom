**Name:** Herondale  
**Region:** Southern Polten, near Rawlinswood  
**Known For:** Agricultural simplicity, quiet roads, and superstitious modesty  
**Status (as of 1372 DR):** Peaceful facade concealing mythic substructures

**Description:**  
Herondale is a small, unassuming village nestled in the southern hills of Polten. Known for its seasonal produce and modest festivals, the town appears tranquil—perhaps too tranquil. Beneath its quaint surface, however, something ancient and echoing stirs.

A recent trail, followed by Baldric and Calanthe, led them to the village’s lone inn and its peculiar mirrored statue. It is here that they discovered signs of a myth-node dormant beneath the town—a tethered echo masquerading as rural peace.

**Notable Features:**  
- **The Glinting Swan Inn:** Main lodging house with a concealed access to the cellar shrine  
- **Mirrored Statue in the Courtyard:** Unknown dedication, shows signs of myth-thread resonance  
- **Ley-Crossing Beneath Village:** Dormant node interface (mirror ritual anchor)  
- **Seasonal Market:** Hosts strange merchant patterns and forgotten folk songs

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Herondale marks the first point at which Baldric and Calanthe engage directly with mythcrafted architecture. The encounter here reveals the blending of rural structure and echo-based falsehood—a foreshadowing of deeper myth-node distortions throughout Damara.
