Session 03 – Trail to Herondale
 Campaign Title: The Waking Vow: Chronicles of the Blooming Dawn

Date of Session: Early–Mid Spring, 1372 DR
 Setting: From Ironspur to the outskirts of Herondale

Summary:
 In the aftermath of their arrival at Ironspur, Baldric and Calanthe investigate the scorched barracks and the half-ruined morale of the surviving knights of the Order of the Aster. Flambard relays troubling news: a sister of the Order was found ranting, burned from within, her mind broken by unnatural echoes. Rumors swirl of false legends and corrupted druids near Rawlinswood.
Together, Baldric and Calanthe question the only surviving witness, speak with Flambard, and begin to piece together the story. A broken sigil—a severed root—draws Calanthe’s attention. Baldric senses the shape of mythic falsehood stirring, not just around the druidic corruption, but in the symbolic echoes of Amaunator and the heresy of the returning Sun Soul.
With no time to waste, Baldric sends scouts into the forest to trace the corrupted druid’s origin. Meanwhile, Priscilla’s trail is picked up again—leading toward the quiet and unassuming town of Herondale.
Baldric, Calanthe, and Invincible take flight.
They land outside the town under the shroud of Pass Without Trace and Invisibility. Priscilla’s trail leads them to an inn and a strange mirrored statue. Below the structure, an eerie cellar echoes with haunting stillness. There, they find signs of ritual—a music box, a mirror, and the weight of twisted memory.
They steel themselves and enter the mirror.
