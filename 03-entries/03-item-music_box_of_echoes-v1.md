**Name:** Music Box of Echoes  
**Type:** Minor Wondrous Item (Myth-Touched)  
**Origin:** Found beneath the Glinting Swan Inn, Herondale  

---

**Description:**  
A delicately carved wooden music box, stained with dried sap and old wax. When opened, it plays a slow, haunting melody that doesn’t always sound the same—sometimes shifting based on who listens. Engraved within the lid are faint glyphs in Druidic and Celestial, partially erased. Its tune seems tied to forgotten memories, mirroring them back in fragments.

---

**Properties:**  
- **Echo Resonance:** When played within 30 feet of a myth-node, faint illusions of past events (real or altered) may flicker into existence  
- **Memory Tether:** Once per day, can replay a listener’s own memory (DM-selected) as a silent illusion  
- **Emotion Keyed:** The music becomes dissonant or calming depending on the emotional state of the one who winds it  
- **Fragmented:** Risk of mythic bleed—repeated exposure may confuse real and false memories (DM discretion)

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Likely used in the original mirror ritual beneath Herondale, this music box was intended to guide memory and identity into sync with the myth-layer being accessed. Its survival suggests someone severed the ritual midstream, preserving the object but leaving the mirror “open.” The box becomes a motif of memory, regret, and unfinished myth.
