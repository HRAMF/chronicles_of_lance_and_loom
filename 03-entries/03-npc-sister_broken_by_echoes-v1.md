**Name:** Unnamed Sister of the Aster  
**Race:** Human  
**Class:** Paladin (formerly), Order of the Aster  
**Current Status:** Alive, catatonic, spiritually fractured  
**Affiliation:** Church of Lathander – Ironspur Chapter  

---

**Description:**  
Once a devout knight of the Aster, this unnamed sister was discovered near the outskirts of Rawlinswood, her armor blackened from within by an arcane fire that left no burn marks on her surroundings. She rants in fragmented prayers and broken songs, referencing "reflected dawns," "the face that wasn’t hers," and "a second sun that screamed."  

She is currently confined to a sanctified chamber beneath Ironspur, tended by cautious clergy and spoken of in whispers by fellow knights.

**Personality Fragmentation:**  
- **Trait (formerly):** Devout, fiercely protective of the innocent  
- **Current State:** Trapped in recursive memory loops, alternating between lucidity and myth-induced delusion  
- **Common Phrases:** “He touched the sun and bled shadow,” “I was her and she was not,” “We woke too early”  

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
The sister serves as one of the earliest human witnesses to direct mythic corruption. Her fractured mind and burned-out bond with her divine magic offer a warning of what may befall others who interact with myth echoes unprepared. She may yet recover—or serve as a vessel for more disturbing revelations.
