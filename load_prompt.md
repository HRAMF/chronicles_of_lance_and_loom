load_prompt.md

Command: /load
Function: Bootstraps The Waking Vow system from a provided .zip archive.


---

Behavior

When this command is issued, and a .zip file is present in the chat:

1. **Extract the archive** to a temporary workspace.

2. **Recursively scan all folders** in the extracted archive.

3. **Locate the first folder that contains `project_instructions.md`**.
   - If multiple folders contain a valid `project_instructions.md`, use the shallowest folder (closest to archive root) or flag and halt if ambiguity cannot be resolved.

4. **Treat that folder as the canonical project root.**
   - All relative paths (e.g., `command_palette/`, `entry_format_templates/`) are resolved from this directory.

5. Parse and execute `project_instructions.md` as the sole driver directive. Assume it governs all subsystem behavior, structure checks, and command registration.

6. Halt if project_instructions.md is missing or malformed.

7. Upon success, respond:
`The Waking Vow system has been initialized. Chronicler, Narrator, and Judge are now active.`

Notes

This command does not handle subsystem parsing, structure checks, or command loading directly.

All behavior is deferred to project_instructions.md.
