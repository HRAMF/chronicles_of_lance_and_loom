Session 04 – Mirrorborn Heresy
 Campaign Title: The Waking Vow: Chronicles of the Blooming Dawn

Date of Session: Mid Spring, 1372 DR
 Setting: The mirror-echo dimension beneath Herondale

Summary:
 Baldric and Calanthe step through the mirror below the Herondale inn, descending into a realm of twisted memory and mirrored truth. Within this pocket of myth—one curated by corrupted echoes and invasive storytelling—they must undergo a sequence of spiritual and symbolic trials. Each is designed not to test their power, but their identity.
Three pillars await them, each named and bound to a trial:
Steel – A challenge of might and resolve


Flame – A test of memory and guilt


Sacrifice – A toll of what one cherishes


Together, they overcome the mental and emotional challenges:
They resist a false narrative attempting to rename Baldric and overwrite his history.


They withstand grief and shame, offering a memory not of joy, but of failure—to preserve truth.


They step through sacrifice, enduring the symbolic cost of walking forward while carrying the burden of what cannot be undone.


Throughout the trial, Baldric draws strength from the Blooming Vow and Calanthe’s shared light. Guidance, Divine Smite, and the Dawnshard’s radiant truth prove instrumental.
At the final step, they recover the echo of Priscilla’s soul, partially bound in myth, and release her by confronting the mirrored falsehood head-on. In doing so, Baldric invokes his vows and the truth of his path—not as a hero shaped by others, but as a man forged by love and legacy.
