Starsteel Heart Relic
Rare Arcane Catalyst (Celestial Source Alloy)
 Origin: Mirror-Echo Trial
Description:
 A fragment of star-metal imbued with dawnlight—once touched by the Weave of an echo-dimension during Baldric’s trial in the mirror realm. Its surface is etched with constellations that shift subtly in response to emotion or divine presence.
Properties:
May be attuned (requires attunement) and used as a spellcasting focus for Paladin or Sorcerer spells.
When used as a focus, once per long rest you may:
Add +1d4 to a radiant damage roll or healing spell.
Automatically succeed on one Concentration check to maintain a radiant or abjuration spell.
When forged into Coronatta, it may:
Grant access to an additional spell or trait tied to your celestial lineage.
Act as the bridge between divine and arcane spellcasting in the weapon.
