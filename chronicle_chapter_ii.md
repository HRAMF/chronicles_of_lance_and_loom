#Sourcing the Graph
* before i provide a list of corrections, and the answers to the question you posed, I would likenyou:
** read and parse graph entry graph/entries-v2/00-entries/00-lore-baldric_early_life-v2.md
** read and parse related entries with edges to and from, with 1 hop max search range
** the contents that were parsed should be correlated to your proposed chapter outline, with the goal of:
- enriching chapter data
- keep it close to established, facts, tones, personalities, atmospheres, etc
* please, prompt me for the project containing the graph entries in case you no longer have access to it.

#Answers
regarding the questions you posed in the `#Questions For You` section, here are my answers:
---
* 1. Key Mentors
** there are many named figures:
- Brother Gylas at the Monatery of the Sun (original character)
- Hanor Kichavo at the Monastery of the Sun (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Hanor_Kichavo)
- Ghentilara at the Spires of the Morning (https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Ghentilara)
- Cyrus Flambard at the Spires of the Morning, and possibly the barracks of the Order of the Aster near the end of Baldric's tenure in Waterdeep, once his calling as a paladin becomes clear
- An ensemble of monks at rhe Monastery of the Sun
- An ensemble of acolytes, clerics and knights at the Spires of the Morning

* 2. Divine Sorcery Manifestation
** I have always imagined Baldric's Divine Sorcery during a sparring match at the end of a training session with a tutor, he achieves a state of flow, deep concentration combined with accute awareness and perfect inner quietude, his manifesting as naturallynas he draws breath, a surge of radiant might bolstering his ablities, allowing him to win the match, under control mirroring his state, his will and intent. To Baldric his divine sorcery was something he had always felt latent, growing but out of reach, until that moment. Embracing it wouldn't do him justice, his magic feels like a part of him, like drawing breath, and also an extension of his will, an integral part of his beign.
- as a side note on this topic: even before magic Baldric showed great potential, his ability to focus, to achieve flow, was noticeable amongst his tutors, wheter while learning, studying or practicing, as thenyears progressed Baldric also developed as a deeply dedicated individual, putting his best effort at everything he attempted was a big part of how  he understood the embodyment of dawn, following Lathanders teachings of constant continuous improvement.

** During his time in Waterdeel, Gylas was his primary caretaker, his reference figure, his principal mentor and teacher. Gylas was Baldric's older brother, not by blood, but by bond

* 4. Tone of the Monastery
** The Monastery of the Sun is an austere, warm and meditative place
** The Spires of the Morning are strict, liturgical for the masses and yet, behind the scenes it was sometimes politic and other times warm and welcoming, martial in it's method of teaching the scriptures, prayers, hymns, tactics, strategy and combat forms
- In Baldric's perspectives both places are complimentary, not opposites. He appreciates the different challenges each temple presents him with

* 5. First Lessons From Aurealis
** Yes, definitively depict a second dream. I do think, however, that once Baldric is set on this path, Aurealis or the other angels of Elysium visit him regularly, sometimes they send him visions, sometimes they exchsnge words and lessons, sometimes visions of Elysium and the hosts/choirs of angels performing rites that spark insightin him.
- their main message should remain what we diacussed previously, with one addition: balance, unity of self. They help Baldric prepare and come to terms with the dualities within him and aorund him naturally, from a perspective of
