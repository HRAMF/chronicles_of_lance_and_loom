Correct Identity and Context of the Third Item:

The item recovered from the Verdant Watcher’s remains and later used in the Everdawn Grove consecration was not the Verdant-Bloom Seed, as earlier misremembered.

It was instead:

The Myth-Burned Seed

Description and Origin:

A relic corrupted by myth, partially seared and blackened by false narrative influence.

It was found in the aftermath of the battle against the skeletal dragon-like Verdant Watcher.

Its potential was uncertain until Baldric entrusted it to Calanthe, saying: “Use it when the time is right.”

Consecration at the Grove of the Everdawn Waltz:

This item was consecrated together with:

1. The Sanctified Myth Anchor (retrieved after the watcher’s fall)


2. The Myth-Threaded Core (reclaimed from the same location)



These three became a mythic triad, forming a symbolic reenactment of:

Corruption (Myth-Burned Seed)

Truth (Myth-Threaded Core)

Binding (Myth Anchor)


Together, they fulfilled the mythic themes of:

> “rebirth, renewal, and redemption grounded in truth and might.”



This directly enabled the consecration of the Grove and was recorded in both:

Baldric’s journal, and

The Waking Vow Leyline file
