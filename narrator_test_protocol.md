Document Title: Narrator Scope & Subtlety – Test Protocol v1
Purpose: Evaluate tone coherence and stylization effectiveness of the Narrator subsystem across mundane and non-mythic contexts in The Waking Vow campaign.


---

Objective

To determine when Narrator stylization improves immersion and narrative tone, and when it detracts from clarity or emotional intent. Focus is on mundane scenes: ambient travel, item interactions, non-divine dialogue, etc.

Test Categories & Sample Scenarios

C1: NPC Giving Directions in a City Square

Scenario: Stablemaster in Trailsend gives directions.

Result: Stylized output enhances voice without loss of clarity.


C2: Entering a Local Tavern

Scenario: PC enters "The Limping Wren."

Result: Stylized version evokes mood; silent output functional but sterile.


C3: Travel Scene Across a Ridge

Scenario: Ridge crossing before sundown.

Result: Stylization adds atmosphere without excess metaphor.


C4: Item Retrieved from a Cart

Scenario: Player finds apricots under canvas.

Result: Stylization mild but borderline unnecessary.


C5: Session Summary Without Mythic Climax

Scenario: Travel, town visit, and camp.

Result: Stylization subtly enhances mundane reflection.


C6: PC–NPC Dialogue (Non-religious)

Scenario: Player asks farmer about ruins.

Result: Stylized voice makes NPC memorable and human.


C7: Internal Monologue During Rest

Scenario: PC reflects on past while camping.

Result: Stylization supports character depth and rhythm.


C8: Combat Setup Against Bandits

Scenario: Standard bridge ambush.

Result: Stylized version is effective if terse; silent better for tactical speed.


C9: Ritual Avoided or Interrupted

Scenario: Caravan disrupts roadside prayer.

Result: Stylization makes absence feel weighty and narrative.


C10: Description of a Mundane Relic

Scenario: Sextant found in merchant crate.

Result: Stylized tone adds minor weight; risk of overuse.

Evaluation Metrics

Metric	Description

Tone Coherence	Does stylization match the emotional weight of the scene?
Narrative Clarity	Is the scene understandable and focused?
Voice Accuracy	Does stylization align with NPC voice sourcing?
Immersive Rhythm	Does the pacing support scene flow?
Stylization Threshold	Should tone have been enhanced, reduced, or suppressed?

Summary Observations

Travel, rest, and silence scenes benefit greatly from poetic narration.

Everyday NPC dialogue becomes memorable through voice sourcing.

Combat or utility scenes demand restraint—stylization is best tight and suggestive.

Broken ritual or mundane introspection gains surprising power when stylized correctly.



---

Recommendations

Maintain stylization for -lore, -npc, -ballad, and narrative flashbacks.

Use /narrate silent for purely mechanical or inventory-centric moments.

Introduce an optional stylize: soft mode for minimal, rhythmic phrasing.

Consider annotating test outputs into a narrator_test_log.md for comparative feedback.
