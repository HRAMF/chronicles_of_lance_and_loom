#Campaign Milestone — Session 2: The First Witness

**SESSION CONTEXT**
Post-Ritual Events | Vigil over the Concord | Awakening the Lens

---

### 1. Major Plotlines

**Versewright Interference (Active Arc)**

* New enemy revealed: The Versewright, a myth-scribe working under the Rotting Man, seeks to rewrite truths anchored by the Concord Line.
* His agents were intercepted at the Coliseum, and may be active near the Echo Cradle.

**Coliseum as Mythic Anchor (New Node)**

* The Coliseum, long corrupted by vines and false memory, was reclaimed by Baldric and Calanthe.
* A hidden chamber beneath the arena revealed the **Lens of First Witness**, an ancient relic linked to the original Concord.

---

### 2. Events and Locations

* **Coliseum**: Sanctified through battle and ritual. Revealed to be a pre-Concord node. The Lens was harmonized through a triadic act.
* **Everdawn Grove**: Core node. Defensive wards completed. Choir established under Priscilla’s direction.
* **Echo Cradle**: Minor disruptions detected. Scouts reported missing. Possible Versewright incursion.
* **Waltzing Dale**: Confirmed by the Lens as the first-ever sanctified Concord site, predating all others.

---

### 3. Trials and Victories

* **Sanctification of the Coliseum**: Baldric and Calanthe defeated corrupted vines unaided. Blooming Vow sigil etched into the Lens.
* **Attunement of the Lens**: Baldric, Calanthe, and Priscilla combined love, duty, and voice to forge the **Oath of Loom and Lance**.
* **Prisoner Interrogation**: Revealed the Versewright’s purpose—to anchor truths under false authorship.

---

### 4. Political Dynamics

* **Ecberth Keenglaive** arrived with 30 house soldiers:

  * 20 stationed at the Coliseum
  * 5 sent to reinforce Echo Cradle and Observatory
  * 5 assigned to scouting between nodes
* House Keenglaive now contributes materially to mythic defense.

---

### 5. Relics and Mythic Tools

* **Dawnlance**: Used to inscribe the Blooming Vow into the Lens.
* **Lens of First Witness** (Awakened):

  * Channels solar power
  * Anchors truth and memory
  * Can serve as the **core of Embermantle’s future myth-forge**
* **Oath of Loom and Lance**: Embedded in lens; triply bound vow now harmonizes all sanctified nodes
* * **Sigil of the Blooming Vow**: written in 3 different locations:
  * Grove of the Blooming Vow
  * Grove of the Everdawn Waltz
  * Coliseum of the First Witness (inscribed eitihe  the Lens)

---

### 6. Character Arcs and Mythos

**Baldric**: Emerges as myth-forger, not merely myth-bearer. Aligns knightly oath, noble duty, and divine love into a unified identity.
**Calanthe**: Guardian of harmony and nature-bound truth. Anchors the Concord not through force, but memory.
**Priscilla**: Voice of the Concord. Now a living sigil within the ritual triad. She names what the land remembers.

---

### 7. Relationship Developments

* Baldric and Calanthe’s unity deepened through shared vigilance and the sacred act of lens consecration.
* Trust between Baldric and Ecberth reinforced through strategic command and shared legacy.

---

### 8. Node State and Leyline Harmony

* **Coliseum of the first Witness**: Newly sanctified, now myth-forge ready.
* **Echo Cradle**: Resonance disturbed. Versewright agents suspected.
* **Grove of the Everdawn Waltz**: Stable. Choir and triad singing truth daily.
* **Observatory**: Stable. Telescope attuned to Chalice Constellation.
* **Waltzing Dale**: Recognized retroactively as Concord’s origin.
* **Grove of Hollowed Roots**: Stable
* **Grove of the Blooming Vow**: Passive sanctum. Stabilized. Blooming glyph effect spreads into flora and wildlife.

---

### 9. Concord Line Effects (Active)

* Nodes share protective resonance. All must fall to break.
* Magic cast at these sites is more truthful and potent.
* Mythic overwriting is repelled unless deeply entrenched.
* Pilgrims aligned with the Blooming Vow gain resonance protections.

---

### 10. Upcoming  Decisions

* **The Vanguard -** Investigate Echo Cradle’s mythic disruption
* **The Dawnforge construction** — Begin preparations for Embermantle’s arrival
* **The Horizon Watch** — Use the telescope to seek Versewright incursions
* **Where the song first began** — Return to Waltzing Dale to explore mythic memory
