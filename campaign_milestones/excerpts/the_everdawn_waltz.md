The relentless charge subsides, Baldric's blazing wrath goes back to smoldering embers. He takes a deep breath.
"A womb, rebirth, renewal. I know what to do"
Baldric moves towards the altar,  with movements of the Dawnshard he traces the Blooming Vow Sigil in sunlight and sacred energy atop it's stone surface. Then, he gathers the myth-threaded core and anchor retrieved from the skeletal dragon, together with the myth burned seed, sanctifying all items with his decisive victory a promise of unfaltering might aimed at restoring what was lost, banishing darkness and revealing the truth, inviting the heavens to be his witness. This reenacts a full cycle of rebirth, renewal and redemption grounded in truth and might. Finally inviting Calanthe to recite the Blooming Vow, anchoring this act in the grander myth being developed upon the Leyline

As Baldric steps forward, the Womb holds its breath.

The light from Dawnshard pulses not in wrath, but in reverence—as its radiant edge traces the sigil of the Blooming Vow upon the altar’s surface. The light etches into the old stone, not burning, but healing. You see the roots recoil, then soften—accepting. Remembering. Opening.

One by one, you place the sacred items:

The Myth-Threaded Core, now inert yet resonant with unraveling.

The Myth Anchor, once a tool of corruption, now a promise to resist.

The Myth-Burned Seed, a symbol of reclaimed truth.


They glow not brightly, but with steady purpose, their resonance harmonizing with the Blooming Sigil you’ve drawn—a song of sacred balance forming.

Then, you turn.

Calanthe joins you, her hand finding yours. Her voice is a melody, full of grace and purpose, as she recites the vow first spoken under a spring sunrise:

> “I open my heart as the land opens to the sun.”
“I receive and return not conquest, but life.”
“Together we dance, we waltz, we bloom.”



And as the final word is spoken, the Womb exhales.

Consecration Complete

A ring of flowers blooms instantly around the altar—orchids, unseen in the north, grow from stone and root.

The leyline brightens, like blood flowing back into a heart.

The altar is now a Sacred Rebirth Nexus, allowing for:

Greater healing, to those who rest here.

Resistance to mythic influence, across the Leyline.

Future ritual potential, including crafting, resurrection, or awakening.


A vision flashes before Baldric’s mind: a battleground, not far south, where another node awaits. A beast of rot, winged and crowned.

But for a moment, in this grove, the dawn has won.


---

The Rot-Mother’s Womb, once a husk of decay and shadow, now pulses with soft life and sacred stillness.

At its center, encircled by the wide roots of an ancient, hollowed tree, stands the stone altar—once pitted and blackened, now glowing with faint golden veins tracing the sigil of the Blooming Vow, freshly carved by the light of Dawnshard. The altar rests atop a natural rise in the grove floor, flanked by vine-wrapped monoliths half-submerged in the loam, forming a kind of druidic compass.

Around the altar, a halo of blossoms has erupted—orchids, moonflowers, golden lilies—each blooming in soft harmony with the constellations of the Chalice above. The roots of the great tree now twist protectively around the clearing, forming arched passageways deeper into the stone and root beneath.

Near the outer edge of the grove, the skeletal remnants of the Verdant Betrayer remain partially entwined with fungal growths, now fading. The Myth-Anchor socket where it had rooted into the ground has sealed, covered with moss and flowering clover.

To the north, a narrow path of luminous ferns traces the path back toward the Observatory Ridge. To the south, the grove slopes toward what looks like a long-buried amphitheater, where the final node’s shadow looms.

Baldric gazes at Calanthe intently, finally extending his hand as an invitation - "I will enjoy our Waltzes till the end of time"
"I think it's time for a new ballad Priscilla, I trust your creative spirit appreciates these stories yes?" - he says, playfully towards an old friend

Priscilla, who had been sitting silently with her journal clutched to her chest—eyes glistening from what she’d just witnessed—blinks twice, then smiles, gently. She rises, brushing a petal from her shoulder, and walks slowly to the center of the blooming circle.

> “You two…” she says, voice catching slightly, “do not just live stories. You make the world feel again.”



She turns to the others—Calanthe, Elowen, even Tamlorn—and opens her journal. With reverence, she kneels before the altar where the sigil glows like a golden heartbeat in the moss-carved stone, and with her voice like bells on dew, she recites:


---

“The Ballad of the Everdawn Waltz”

> When wrath had waned and dawnlight wept,
Where rot once ruled, a promise slept.
The flame did fall, the blade did break,
But vows endured for mercy’s sake.



> Two hearts entwined, no crown, no throne,
Their root was love, their light their own.
Through sword and bloom, they danced anew,
And woke the world to what is true.



> So sing it now, let memory bend—
The Everdawn Waltz shall never end.




---

As she finishes, the grove responds.

The golden veins pulse once, then fix in place, locking the name into the stone.

The flowers all turn toward the altar, as if reaching for the sun.

And far above, through the canopy, a break in the clouds casts a perfect column of light through the center of the circle.



---

The Rot-Mother’s Womb has been reborn as:

The Grove of the Everdawn Waltz

The name is now etched into myth and memory.
You feel it resonate across the leyline—truth anchoring itself.

Would you like Priscilla to scribe this moment into Baldric’s journal as the next entry before your party sets eyes on the amphitheater below?
