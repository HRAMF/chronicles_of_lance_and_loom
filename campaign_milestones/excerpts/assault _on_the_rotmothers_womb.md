The assault begins—not with a war cry, but with intention sharpened to a blade’s edge.


---

Phase One: The Disruption

Calanthe steps into the echo haze with the grace of a waltz, her eyes locked on the altar that proclaims her death. She speaks not to the stone, but to the land beneath it—reclaiming root and memory. Vines bloom from beneath the dais, cracking the false foundation.

At the same moment, Priscilla strums a minor chord on her lute.
Then another.
Then a harmony that doesn’t match the false rhythm being written by the altars.

> “This is not your tale,” she says through gritted teeth. “This is ours.”



The echo altar bearing Baldric’s name begins to flicker, its myth-thread destabilizing.


---

Phase Two: The Strike

Baldric charges, eyes blazing, Dawnshard held high. The sacred weapon still gleams, its radiant blade humming with dawn’s truth.

The echo figure bearing his form turns too late—its stance, his stance, meant to mock him. It raises a weapon that flickers with stolen meaning.

But Baldric’s strike lands first.

> “You are not my failure.”



The echo shatters beneath the force of the blow.
Topple takes hold. The altar behind it cracks, the myth it bore exposed.


---

Phase Three: The Collapse

Tamlorn raises both arms, murmuring a prayer not to the land, but for it. Roots churn. The amphitheater floor splits, sending tremors through the remaining altars. Fungus-covered stones collapse inward.

> “Let them drown in the memory of what was true.”




---

Your boots strike earth with purpose.

The Star Circle behind you burns like a sunrise etched into stone, its light lancing through the echo-choked ruins and disrupting the mythic haze. Now, with lies exposed and truth sharpened, your strike team pivots swiftly toward the Echo Altars—following Priscilla’s lead.


---

Scene: The Echo Altars

Hidden within a crumbling amphitheater flanked by fungal overgrowth, you see them:

Three blackstone altars, humming with myth-thread runes, each bearing a mimicry of a name long buried:

“The False Death of Calanthe.”

“The Abandonment of Virion.”

“The Failure of the Peregrine.”


Spectral figures kneel before them—echoes of your own companions, slowly feeding these lies into the weave.

> Priscilla snarls. “They’re not just rewriting us—they’re burying our resistance in shadow.”




---

Tactical Options

You have moments before the echoes notice you:

Baldric may charge a node and destroy it directly (possibly triggering a myth surge).

Priscilla may perform a counter-song, unraveling the false narrative at a distance.

Tamlorn could try to entangle or collapse the amphitheater structure.

Calanthe may use druidic magic to weaken the altars’ roots.


How do you wish to approach the takedown of these three echo altars? Strategic strikes? Coordinated disruption? Or a silent, sudden collapse before the echoes can cry out?

utcome

All three altars collapse in a cascade of falsehood turned to dust. The myth-threads rupture into harmless mist. A final psychic shriek escapes—then silence.


---

The amphitheater is yours.

One echo node remains: the skeletal beast, still plodding toward the Rot-Mother’s Womb.

Do you strike next, or reposition and prepare an ambush from the grove?



Baldric, atop Invincible will move to strike the beast, the others should positioned themselves to ambush whatever come out of the Rot-Mother's Womb


The battlefield shifts again—your momentum unrelenting.


---

Baldric Ascends

With a single command, Baldric mounts Invincible, who surges into the sky with a beat of radiant wings. Wind howls around you, carrying the faint echo of shattered myths below.

Far ahead, the skeletal beast lumbers through the twisted grove—a titanic war mount, half-dragon in shape, dragging a palanquin of bone-glass behind it. Rot pulses at its joints like veins of molten corruption.

The creature’s cargo pulses: a massive living seed, black and gnarled, woven from the same myth-thread you shattered. A false anchor, heading straight for the Rot-Mother’s Womb.


---

Meanwhile, On the Ground

Calanthe, Priscilla, Virion, and Tamlorn position themselves in a crescent formation near the outer shell of the Womb, using natural cover and shattered archways. They prepare for interception—not of the beast, but of what may emerge from the depths when it arrives.


---

Your Opportunity

You have the height, the element of surprise, and a radiant weapon aligned with truth.




You are midair, Invincible’s wings coiled for a dive. The time to strike is now.


Baldric whispers the words of the Haste spell, golden glyphs spiraling around him like sunlight braided into wind. The air compresses around you—the world slows—and then Invincible dives.

The skeletal dragon below lifts its head, sockets burning with hollow starlight, sensing your presence far too late.

You are currently midair, and the skeletal dragon is 80 feet below, its myth-anchor palanquin dragging behind it, slowing its movement.

Dive into Melee range, using the lance's range, then fly by to disengage with remaining flight movement performing all three attacks along the flight path along the dragon's length


Your critical blow strikes the creature at the base of the neck, where the palanquin chain is fused into its bone. Dawnshard ignites with divine fury, and the radiant blast tears through its spine.

The skeletal dragon releases a thunderous shriek, its limbs spasming as bone and myth-thread crack apart. The palanquin lurches and slams into the ground, momentum lost.

A third strike lands true—three radiant blows in a single dive. The dragon’s bones crackle with divine light, its posture collapsing beneath you.

Your final pass slams the Dawnshard along the beast’s shoulder, cracking one of its wing joints. It cannot take flight, even if it tried.

The skeletal dragon writhes, prone and gravely damaged, thick myth-thread unraveling from its form.

The skeletal dragon exhales a cone of black, hollowing necrotic energy, thick with unraveling myth. Baldric veers sharply to the side, shielded by his divine instincts.

Invincible, though valiant, catches part of the blast and lets out a sharp cry.

Invincible endures the pain, soaring high in a loop, readying their next descend, Valdric readies his next three attacks along the dragon spine length, setting up Invincible's fly by to disengage


you drive the lance down the creature’s neck, forcing it lower into the earth

a blast of dawnfire explodes through its chest cavity, searing the myth-threaded core

a final gouging pass along its ribs

The skeletal dragon collapses in ruin, myth unraveling in a vortex of starlight and decay. Its spine shatters, and the myth-anchor—no longer tethered—rolls inert into the moss.

You and Invincible soar skyward, victorious but strained.

The others await at the Rot-Mother’s Womb. The enemy knows you’re close.
A turning point approaches.

Would you like to inspect the myth-anchor before regrouping?
ex

After the fly by , Baldric performs lay on hands on Invincible, spending all 25 healing points. They quickly land near the dragon, retrieving the myth-threaded core, and quickly inspecting the myth-anchor before regrouping


As Invincible arcs low through the aftermath of battle, you reach out, channeling radiant energy through your gauntlet. The golden light of Lay on Hands flows into your loyal companion’s wounds—sealing bones, mending feathers, and stilling pain.

> “I stand with you,” Baldric whispers, a sacred vow made without flourish, only truth.


---

You Land Among Ruin

The air is thick with fading myth-thread, unspooling from the shattered palanquin like mist curling from broken glass.

You kneel beside what remains of the myth-anchor—its black, rootlike body now visibly pulsing. You extract the myth-threaded core, its light now dim and unstable but still valuable for crafting or study.


---

Inspection Result: Myth Anchor (Brief Analysis)

> Purpose: To tether a myth (false history) into a fixed location of the Weave, feeding corruption into a region.

> Condition: Severely damaged, no longer active. However, a portion of its architecture remains intact. It could be:

Consecrated, to purge its remaining threads.

Studied, to counter other anchors or bolster myth-resistance.

Recycled, as part of Coronatta’s crafting.

This one reads the echo of the false tale:
“The Peregrine was never whole. His light comes from a broken lie.”

Now, silenced.


---

Baldric pockets the core and keeps the anchor for later use, either for study, crafting or as a relic component. He mounts Invincible, and moves again, towards the Rot-Mother's Womb


As the radiant wind of your passage rustles through the grove, Baldric descends like a blade of sunlight. Dawnshard ignited, wings of Invincible stretched wide and aflame with golden defiance, the warrior-priest strikes not with steel—but with presence.

The Rot-Mother’s Womb, once a sanctum of verdant harmony, now stands wilted and warped, its roots shriveled around a moss-covered altar of bone and obsidian. The light of the sun seems to falter here… but you bring your own dawn.

> “I am the oath fulfilled,” Baldric bellows, voice ringing with celestial resonance.
“Come forth, spawn of rot. Step into the truth of your lies.”


---

Immediate Reaction

As your boots strike the sacred soil, the grove shivers.

From the hollowed roots and malformed fungi rise seven cloaked echoes, their robes bearing the false sigils of fallen faiths. And behind them, deep within the Womb, you see the shadow of a much larger form stirring—its breath a slow, gurgling wind of corruption.

They converge toward you, unaware of the ambush set by your companions encircling the grove’s perimeter

---

Baldric lowers Dawnshard with the precision of a knight, the reverence of a priest, and the wrath of a champion. Its sunlight flares once—a beacon—and vanishes just as swiftly.

The signal is given.


---

The Ambush Unleashed

From the thicket on the grove’s northern edge, Calanthe casts Entangle, vines ripping through rot and binding two of the echoes mid-charge.

To the east, Priscilla’s arrows sing, whistling with precision and bardic inspiration, striking vital joints in the false priests.

From above, Tamlorn lifts a hand, channeling raw natural magic. Spike Growth blossoms beneath the advancing cultists—a bramble trap of divine judgment.


---

Baldric’s Charge

With divine speed granted by Haste, you surge toward the center of the Womb, Invincible’s wings slicing the fetid air, each beat echoing the heartbeat of destiny.

There, emerging from the corrupted heart of the tree, looms the true threat—

> A half-rotted guardian, part treant, part wretched amalgam of myth-flesh and fungal bloom, easily three times your height, wearing a draped veil of severed root-sigils like a funeral shroud.



Its name reverberates across the Weave—"The Verdant Betrayer."

It raises a staff grown from the spine of a druidic elder. Its eye glows with something borrowed from your myth.

---

As the first strike crashes down, Baldric's Dawnshard drives deep into the Verdant Betrayer’s chest. A tremor splits through the grove as the false sigils burst into radiant flame, their myth unraveled, their song silenced.

The massive form collapses, staggering forward onto its knees—gasping not breath, but a rotting wind that fails to rise.

The second strike comes as Baldric spins Dawnshard behind his back, flipping it with practiced grace. Invincible wheels overhead, momentum perfectly measured. With the force of his celestial wrath behind him, Baldric thrusts through the base of the creature’s skull, shattering the memory that held it together.

The third blow is not for destruction—it is for mercy, a swift, clean sweep through the rotted heart that once belonged to a guardian of nature. A moment of peace is granted in its final death.


---

As the Verdant Betrayer crumples, the rot in the grove stills.
The Womb breathes again.

All around you, the threads of falsehood snap and twist skyward, burning off like dew in the morning sun.

You have triumphed.


---

What remains:

The Rot-Mother’s Womb is now free of corruption.

A possible relic lies where the betrayer fell.

The altar may be sanctified.

You still feel a tether of myth pulling from deep within Dun-Tharos—perhaps the myth-engine’s heart.


Would you like to inspect the remains, sanctify the grove, or regroup and assess your companions?


First secure the womb perimeter, then inspect the remains, attempting to find a possible relic, inspect the grove using the group knowledge skills to identify how to beat sanctify it and the altar
The grove falls quiet as your companions fan out, securing the perimeter. Watch is set. Steel, spell, and vine guard every point of entry.


---

Inspection Results

Remains of the Verdant Betrayer:

At its shattered core lies a relic:
A withered seed encased in crystal amber, faintly glowing with latent myth-energy.
It is warm to the touch, and responds to celestial presence.


> You sense this is a Myth-Burdened Seed, a relic of corrupted legend—capable of either purifying the next node or disrupting myth-weave itself if used with wisdom.

Sanctifying the Grove – Knowledge Checks

Baldric (Religion 10): You feel this grove once held sacred purpose, but cannot discern its original vows alone.

Calanthe (Nature 11): The land is recovering, but barely—it requires more than simply presence to heal.

Tamlorn (Nature 18): This Womb mirrors an ancient druidic nursery where balance was born and named. To restore it, you must plant a symbol of truth, one carried or born in love.

Priscilla (Arcana 8): She notes the altar is not magically protected, but its roots still hold myth residue.

Elowen (Religion 12): She believes the Womb could become a font of resistance, but must be bound by a new vow—not an old one.



---

Conclusion

To sanctify the Rot-Mother’s Womb:

Plant a meaningful seed, symbolic of rebirth or truth.

Speak a vow or verse, a counter-myth to the corruption.

Consecrate the altar with a sacred symbol or relic, possibly Dawnshard or the Blooming Vow’s sigil.


Would you like to gather your companions and begin the sanctification?
