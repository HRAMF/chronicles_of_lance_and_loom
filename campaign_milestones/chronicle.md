The Chronicle of Loom and Lance

Chapter I: Of Blood and First Light

(1344–1351 DR – The Childhood and Pilgrimage of Baldric Keenglaive)


---

There are children born beneath prophecy—and others, beneath purpose.
Baldric Keenglaive was born under both.

It was in the cusp of winter, 1344 DR, in the wind-swept Barony of Polten, that he entered the world. Not amid banners or horns, but between furrowed fields and the incense of morning bread. His first cry rang out not in a castle—but in a stone-barn turned sanctuary, as a soft dawn broke across the Lake of Mogador. His mother wept in silence. His father, Wycbuhr, named him after no ancestor—but after a vision.

From the first, he bore signs not easily ignored. His eyes glowed with warm white light, like the first rays that crown the horizon. His skin was fair and rosed, but under the sun it shimmered with a metallic bronze sheen, as if kissed by the forge of the heavens. And his hair, full and dark as the void before morning, framed a face that seemed wrought not from clay, but promise.

They did not know what he would become.
But the heavens already did.

The Keenglaives of Polten

The Keenglaive line was not noble in birth, but in burden. Once humble farmers, they had risen to Barony through Sygeweard’s valor at the Battle of Goliad, where he held the retreating Damaran flank long enough for Gareth Dragonsbane to rally what remained. Their symbol was not a crown—but a glaive embedded in stone, watched always by the morning sun.

Polten itself was a hard land, bordered by wild forest and whispered threats. It did not welcome the radiant. But it needed them.

Baldric grew amid polearm drills and prayers in barn-altars. He memorized lineages not to boast, but to serve. Yet there was something in the child that did not wait to be shaped: radiant eyes that warmed the hearth, a presence that made the devout pause in reverence, and hands that calmed even wild horses.

Signs and Counsel

Wycbuhr Keenglaive—stern, brilliant, loyal—feared the gift. Not for what it was, but for what it would attract.

By 1351 DR, with Zheng-Yi’s shadow stretching from Vaasa, Wycbuhr sought counsel. In Helgabal, he conferred with three figures: Brother Dugald of Ilmater, Kane of the Yellow Rose, and Gareth Dragonsbane himself. Dugald proposed Ilmater’s path—humility through suffering. Kane, monk of insight, laid no hand upon Baldric, but stared long into his eyes. And then he spoke:

> “He is not made to be hidden beneath pain. His joy will be a sword. His silence, a sanctuary. The dawn has chosen.”



And so it was decided.

The Pilgrimage West

Baldric departed before his eighth spring. Not in chains, not in shame—but in promise. It was a pilgrimage, born of love and foresight. He would go west, to Waterdeep, escorted by Brother Gylas—a monk of the Order of the Sun Soul who carried no weapon but memory.

Wycbuhr did not weep. He gripped Baldric’s shoulder, placed the family seal in his palm, and said:

> “Not all inheritances weigh the same, my boy. Yours is heavier than most. But we’ve made it sturdy in you. You carry our name, our hopes, and a fire that’s yours alone. When the road feels long, remember what planted you—and what you might light in others.”



Gylas and Baldric walked, rode, and sometimes slept beneath quiet skies. Along the way, they visited shrines of Lathander. Gylas never preached. He told stories. Of people who failed and tried again. Of those who chose to build, not to conquer. Of mornings after the worst of nights.

And the boy listened.

The Voice in the Dream

It was in the third season of their travel, amidst the hush of a winter, still weeks away from Waterdeep, that Baldric first heard the voice in the dream:

A golden field stretched before him. A lance stood upright in the earth, untouched by shadow. Around him, feathers fell—not from sky, but from radiance itself, shimmering like the sun’s corona at first light.

A woman stood at the far edge of the field—tall, armored in resplendent light, her wings vast and unfurled like dawn stretched wide. Her face bore the strength of stone, and the kindness of a mother who had already forgiven what had not yet been done.

> “Do not fear what makes you different. The world will. That is not your burden.”

“You were made to rise when others break. To shield, to guide, to shine.”

“Remember this: courage is not in the silence before battle—but in the stand you take when none stand with you.”



He knew her name before she gave it. Aurealis—a beacon of Valor, a voice from the fields of Elysium.

The next morning, Gylas said nothing, but watched him from across the fire. Then, with care, he handed Baldric a small braided cord. “You’ve met her,” he said gently. “She’s watched you longer than I have.”

And So the Journey Begins

By the time they reached the gates of Waterdeep, Baldric no longer walked like a child. He did not carry righteousness—but he carried awareness. He did not speak of miracles—but he listened when the wind shifted.

In the heart of a vast city, among strangers, he would soon find his first brotherhood. But that is another chapter.

For now, he crossed into the city of splendors with only this:
A cord of sun-gilded thread, a family sigil, and a name whispered in firelight:

Aurealis.

Chapter II: Of Dawn and Discipline

(1351–1356 DR – The Waterdeep Years)

To step into Waterdeep was to step into the breath of a giant.

Baldric Keenglaive, seven winters old, did not flinch. He stood at the gates with Gylas beside him, a hand on the hilt of the unknown. And beyond, in the stone courtyards and temple spires of the City of Splendors, his second home awaited—tempered not in blood, but in vow.

The Monastery of the Sun

The monastery rose like a hymn in stone—quiet, deliberate, composed. There were no banners, no brazen calls to arms. Only bells in the morning, and silence in the dusk.

Here, Baldric began his training among monks of the Sun Soul—those who believed that light was not taught, but revealed through movement, stillness, breath. His tutors praised not his strength, but his presence: the way he listened without fidgeting, moved without waste, held silence like a chalice.

He studied polearm forms at dawn and transcribed prayers at twilight. He whispered Lathander’s morning hymns to himself while scrubbing floors. And slowly, the monastery shaped him—not into something new, but into someone returning.

The Spires of the Morning

By the time he was nine, Gylas led him to the high temples: The Spires of the Morning, where light pierced through golden windows and prayers thundered like marches.

There, he met Ghentilara, stern and splendid, who watched him kneel and whispered to another priest: “That one has the sun in his marrow.” He was placed into liturgical training—learning tactics and scripture side by side, song and formation, mercy and war.

Where the monastery was inward, the Spires were outward. But Baldric did not see contradiction. He saw balance.

The Awakening

It was during a sparring session in his eleventh year that it came: not a flash, but a flow.

He moved without thinking—graceful, unwavering. Each strike sang. And as the bout neared its end, something stirred. Not wrath. Not victory. But clarity.

Radiance pooled in his limbs—not like fire, but breath. A surge that mirrored his stillness. His final strike glowed gold and soft—and his opponent fell, unharmed, but dazed by brilliance.

There was no outcry. No fear. Only silence. And then applause.

Gylas smiled, for the first time in weeks, and simply said, “You remembered.”

The Second Dream

That night, Aurealis returned.

This time, not alone. Behind her stood figures in rows—robed, winged, gleaming with Elysium’s clarity. They sang, but the song was not for Baldric. It was about him.

“Strength must hold, not crush.”

“Light must pierce, not blind.”

“You are not one or the other. You are the moment they meet.”

She stepped forward, touched his brow, and whispered:

“Balance is not stillness. It is flight with two wings.”

And he woke with tears on his cheeks.

In his fifth year in Waterdeep, the boy who had arrived with a sigil and a song now stood on the threshold of oath. Not yet a knight. Not yet a blade. But he had become something rarer:

A vessel of discipline. A student of radiance. A son of dawn.

The next chapter would begin north, beneath the silver stars of another city, where destiny would test not his soul—but his resolve.
