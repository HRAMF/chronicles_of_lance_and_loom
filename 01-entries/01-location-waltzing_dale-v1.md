**Description:**  
A serene and hidden dale nestled among wooded hills and flowering meadows, Waltzing Dale is both home and sanctuary to Baldric and Calanthe. Spring-fed and song-filled, the location embodies the mythic and emotional core of the Waking Vow. Elder trees watch over a still pond, upon whose surface the couple performed the Waltz of Renewal during their wedding.

The dale pulses faintly with awakened natural and divine energies, seemingly responding to the couple’s union and bond. It is a place of healing, renewal, and quiet revelation.
