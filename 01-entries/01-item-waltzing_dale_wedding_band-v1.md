**Worn By:** Baldric Keenglaive

---

**Description:**  
A ring of interwoven copper and silver bands, inset with a small dawn opal and a sliver of oakhorn root. This wedding band was exchanged between Baldric and Calanthe during the Waltz of Renewal. Its enchantments are bound not to arcane formulae but to love, intention, and a sacred oath shared beneath sun and stars.

- **+1 to AC and Saving Throws**  
- **Sanctified Bond:** While within 30 feet of the bonded partner, both wearers gain resistance to fear effects  
- **Vow Anchor:** Can be used once per long rest to reroll a failed Wisdom saving throw (shared pool between bonded pair)

- Telepathic communication  
- Myth-resistance while performing rites together  

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
A literal and symbolic anchor of the Waking Vow, the wedding bands of Waltzing Dale represent the harmony between leaf and flame, dawn and root. They are not merely magical trinkets, but living relics of love and purpose.
