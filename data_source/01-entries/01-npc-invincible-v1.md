**Description:**  
A noble steed of radiant grace, Invincible manifests with a luminous white coat tinged with warm undertones of sunrise gold. His wings span wide with feathers that shimmer faintly with dawnlight.

Proud and dignified, Invincible possesses the calm of an ancient soul. Though he speaks little (if at all), his presence radiates courage, patience, and silent understanding. He does not follow commands so much as he aligns himself with Baldric’s convictions.

- **Trait:** Will never retreat while Baldric stands.  
- **Ideal:** Glory through service, serenity through flight.  
- **Bond:** Bound to Baldric by pact and purpose—appears only when truly needed.

**Narrative Significance:**  
First summoned in Session 01 as part of the couple’s preparation to leave Waltzing Dale, Invincible is more than a mount. He is a visible manifestation of Baldric’s bond with the heavens and his role as a divine emissary. His appearance marks turning points and sacred undertakings—each flight a vow.
