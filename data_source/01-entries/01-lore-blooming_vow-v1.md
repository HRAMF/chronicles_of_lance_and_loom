**Description:**  
The Blooming Vow is the sacred oath of love and purpose exchanged between Baldric and Calanthe during their wedding at Waltzing Dale. Performed barefoot upon the mirrored waters of the dale’s sacred pond, it united not only their hearts, but their destinies—an act witnessed by nature, divine forces, and myth itself.

The vow invoked more than matrimonial promise: it created a metaphysical bond that resonates with sanctified sites, mythic leylines, and relics attuned to life, renewal, and divine truth. The land itself responded, and over time, the vow has become a stabilizing force amid mythic corruption.
