**Name:** Daelegoth Orndeir  
**Race:** Genasi (Fire)  
**Class:** Cleric (Domain of Light)  
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral  
**Title:** Sunlord of the Glorious Dawn  
**Affiliation:** Founder of the Glorious Dawn Brotherhood; spiritual leader in Elversult

---

**Role in Narrative:**  
Daelegoth is the central figure behind the **Risen Sun Heresy**—a charismatic preacher and radiant orator whose sermons proclaim that **Lathander is merely the morning face of Amaunator**, the ancient solar deity of Netheril. He does not speak in defiance—he speaks in **fulfillment**, as if revelation has dawned through him alone.

To Baldric, he is not a villain—but a warning: a man whose **certainty eclipses compassion**.

---

**Personality and Voice:**  
- **Voice:** Commanding, luminous, always addressing the crowd even in private  
- **Disposition:** Charismatic and precise, with the aura of divine appointment  
- **Habits:** Speaks in metaphors of light, rebirth, and inevitability  
- **Beliefs:** Doctrine must evolve. The faith must survive, even if it must be reshaped

---

**Key Moments with Baldric:**  
- **Banquet of the Risen Sun:** Invites Baldric to witness the “awakening” of the faith  
- **Doctrinal Challenge:** Refers to Baldric as “a knight of dawn not yet risen to full flame”  
- **Moral Pressure:** Attempts to conscript Baldric’s reputation to sanctify the movement

Baldric listens. Does not argue. But his silence is not assent.

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
Daelegoth represents **charisma without humility**—a dangerous trait in any priest, and doubly so in one who commands the stage. He is not malicious. He is **convinced**. And in that conviction, he cannot see the line between illumination and conflagration.
