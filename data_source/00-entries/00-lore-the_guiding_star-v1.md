**Lore Entry: The Guiding Star**

**Name:** The Guiding Star  
**Theme:** Public memory, luminous leadership, love as stewardship  
**Timeframe:** 1366 DR onward

---

**Narrative:**  
In Polten, there is no border between land and memory.  
And in the Waltzing Dale, the crops do not grow only because the soil is fertile.

They grow because she *listens*.

---

**Who She Became:**  
After her union with Baldric Keenglaive, Calanthe Forgecrown became more than a druid.  
She became a **compass**.

Not a ruler, not a priestess—but the guiding rhythm behind both. Where Baldric was presence, she was **pattern**. Where he shielded, she **tethered**. She walked the fields with her sleeves rolled, not her title raised.

Children learned the stars from her stories.  
Lumberers came to her with offerings—not permits.  
Wolves did not cross her boundary, not out of fear, but because **they were asked**.

---

**At the Waltzing Dale:**  
Only after settling the Dale did Calanthe join the **Circle of Leth**.  
They did not call her apprentice.

They called her *The Guiding Star*—the one who leads not by command, but by course.

She taught that balance is not stasis. It is **movement with care**.

Where Baldric held audiences, she walked the orchards.  
Where treaties were signed, she placed wildflowers.  
Where others gave sermons, she gave seeds.

---

**Legacy and Reverence:**  
Among the people of Damara, Calanthe is not remembered only for her vows.

She is remembered for:
- **Bringing joy back to the farmers**
- **Treating hedge witches with dignity**
- **Sitting beside widows in silence, with no need to fill it**

Her name is invoked in midsummer rites.  
Her words are sung by circle-keepers when the harvest breaks wrong.  
And to the lost, her stories always end with the same invitation:

> “Follow the stars.  
> Then follow what sings beneath them.”

---

**Closing Thought:**  
> Her light did not lead by height or flame—  
> But by **constancy**.  
>  
> She is the star that returns each night.  
>  
> And the land is better for it.
