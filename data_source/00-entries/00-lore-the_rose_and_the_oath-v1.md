**Name:** The Rose and the Oath  
**Theme:** Tension Between Discipline and Devotion, Institutional Faith, Pathways of Light

---

**Origin:**  
The phrase “The Rose and the Oath” is used by aspirants and theologians in Waterdeep to describe the philosophical divergence between two radiant orders: the **Order of the Sun Soul**, rooted in self-mastery and experiential harmony, and the **Order of the Aster**, grounded in ecclesiastic hierarchy and knightly obedience.

The “Rose” symbolizes **graceful strength**, flexibility, and quiet illumination—traits prized in sun-soul monasteries. The “Oath” represents **clarity of vow**, unwavering structure, and militant virtue as embodied in the doctrines of the Aster.

Many disciples trained in both circles must eventually choose their guiding path. Few navigate both.

---

**Expression in the World:**  
- The Orders share rites, doctrine, and reverence for Lathander, but differ in tone and posture.  
- Spires of the Morning enforces the Oath’s rigor; the Monastery of the Sun encourages the Rose’s grace.  
- Those who serve in battle or politics are expected to align with the Oath. Those who guide, heal, or protect sacred memory often follow the Rose.

**Impact on Baldric Keenglaive:**  
This divergence shaped Baldric’s adolescence. During his transition to the **Spires of the Morning**, he began to experience tension between **freedom of presence** and **duty to rank**.

Flambard, as an instructor, pressed upon Baldric the necessity of clarity, order, and command. But Baldric, even as he obeyed, retained the flexibility and internal compass taught to him by the Rose. This created friction, but also depth.

Rather than choosing between the two, Baldric began to synthesize them—seeking not balance, but a higher form of wholeness.
