*Type: lore-entry*

---

**Family Name:** House Keenglaive  
**Region of Influence:** Barony of Polten, Damara  
**Status:** Noble House (elevated by decree of King Gareth Dragonsbane)  
**Known For:** Rural valor, polearm martial tradition, and early Lathanderite devotion in the Bloodstone Lands

---

**Origins & Martial Tradition:**  
Originally an influential family of farmers in Polten, the Keenglaives honed a **generational martial tradition centered on polearms**—a practical discipline rooted in agricultural tools and refined through years of militia service. Their doctrine prized **reach, leverage, and unity of formation**—tactics that later served them in war.

Unlike many northern houses, the Keenglaives also worshipped **Lathander**, a southern god, blending seasonal agrarian rites with morning devotion—a spiritual legacy that made them unique among Damaran nobility.

**The Battle of Goliad – Defining Legacy:**  
In 1357 DR, under the leadership of **Sygeweard “the Elder”**, the Keenglaives held the **left flank of King Virdin’s army** during the disastrous Battle of Ford Goliad. Their disciplined resistance allowed hundreds of soldiers to retreat across the Laço de Gelo and escape the trap laid by Zheng-Yi, the Witch-King of Vaasa.

Many died. Sygeweard and his kin paid in blood.

**Elevation to Nobility:**  
In recognition of their valor and sacrifice, **King Gareth Dragonsbane** later granted the family control over the Barony of Polten. The former ruling family, BelMaris, perished in the war, and their surviving cadet line now resides in Impiltur, occasionally contesting the Keenglaives’ claim.
