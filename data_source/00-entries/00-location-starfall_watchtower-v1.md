**Name:** Starfall Watchtower  
**Region:** Unnamed island within the Sea of Fallen Stars (off the Dragon Coast)  
**Affiliation:** Formerly Lathanderite (abandoned); presently unclaimed  
**Known For:** Lighthouse ruins, pirate entrapments, cliffside predator lairs

---

**Description:**  
The island is little more than a wound jutting from the Starfall Sea—a place of black rocks, wind-carved cliffs, and a tower built for warning, not welcome. Once a beacon for ships sailing under the Dawnlord’s banner, the **Starfall Watchtower** now stands broken, its glass eye shattered and its flame snuffed.

From its heights, the sea can be seen for miles. From its base, bones drift in tidal pools.

---

**Historical Role:**  
The watchtower was raised generations ago by Lathanderite missionaries seeking to guide pilgrims from the Vilhon Reach to Cormyr and beyond. It was abandoned after several pirate incursions—its bell broken, its clergy lost.

Legends say the final Dawnwarden rang the bell as pirates scaled the rocks. The sound was never heard on the mainland.

**Events or Encounters:**  
- **Shipwrecked:** During a storm, Baldric and his contingent are cast ashore after their vessel is lured in by a false light and destroyed on the rocks.  
- **Sabotaged Beacon:** The watchtower’s flame had been replaced by **alchemical lanterns**—a trap set by pirates to harvest wreckage and survivors.  
- **The Cliffs Hunt:** A monstrous, winged predator nested within the tower’s belfry, feeding on survivors until Baldric **regained the tower** by tactics and light.

---

**Spiritual Significance:**  
The Starfall Watchtower is not merely ruined—it is **betrayed**. A place once meant to **guide** had been turned to **trap**. Baldric’s reclamation of it marks a moment not of purity regained, but of **light restored through strategy and defiance**.
