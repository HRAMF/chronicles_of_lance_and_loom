**Name:** Baldric Keenglaive  
**Focus:** Martial and Magical Training, Devotional Disciplines, and the Emergence of the Third Path  
**Timeframe:** 1352–1365 DR

---

**Summary:**  
Baldric’s training was neither solely martial nor strictly spiritual—it was **ritual, memory, awakening**. Across temples, monasteries, and vision-drenched sanctuaries, Baldric walked a training path that honored both earth and heaven. He was molded by voices of contrast: the flame of Cyrus Flambard, the song of Arran Brightsmile, the silence of Hanor Kichavo, and the warmth of Brother Gylas.

Each offered him a fragment. Together, they called forth the foundation of what would one day become the **Third Path**.

**Doctrinal Tension:**

Here, the seed of the **Blooming Vow** began to stir.

**Narrative Significance:**  
This period forged not just a paladin or a sorcerer—but a man whose light does not blind, and whose sword is planted as often as it is raised. It was in these years that Baldric stopped being merely promising and became **myth-bearing**.
