**Name:** Sunlit Formations of the Soul  
**Theme:** Monastic Devotion, Dawnlit Discipline, Internal Illumination

---

**Origin:**  
Rooted in the teachings of the **Order of the Sun Soul**, the Sunlit Formations are a series of devotional rites, movement meditations, and breath-mapped mantras practiced by young initiates at the **Monastery of the Sun** in Waterdeep. They are not merely martial kata or spiritual exercises—but **ritual harmonizations of the body and soul** with the first light of morning.

Their origins trace back to Hanor Kichavo’s early reforms, intended to make the order accessible not only to warriors, but to orphans, aspirants, and vision-touched children.

**Expression in the World:**  
- Each formation is named for a celestial moment (e.g., *Breath Before Horizon*, *Step of the Second Ray*, *Shadow’s Departure*)  
- Practiced at dawn by students, paladins, and sun-souled monks  
- Considered a sacred preparation for the soul’s alignment with divine will

**Impact on Baldric Keenglaive:**  
These formations shaped Baldric’s core identity. As a young aasimar, his radiance made him feel alien in many settings—but here, it was welcomed, even celebrated.

Within the cadence of the **Dawn Yard**, he learned to breathe with reverence, strike with grace, and pause with purpose. The early forms did not suppress his divine spark—they **taught it to dance**. His eventual emergence as a paladin of both will and wonder owes as much to these rituals as to his formal training.

It was during a **dawn formation** that Baldric first experienced a **dreamlike state of communion**—a moment scholars believe marked the earliest contact with **Auréalis**.
