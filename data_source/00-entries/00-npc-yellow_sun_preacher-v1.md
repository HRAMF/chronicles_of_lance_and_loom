**Name:** Unknown (called “The Preacher of the Yellow Sun”)  
**Race:** Human (Chondathan descent, by accent)  
**Class:** Cleric (Domain of Light, heretical expression)  
**Alignment:** Lawful Neutral  
**Title:** Itinerant Acolyte of the Glorious Dawn Brotherhood  
**Affiliation:** Risen Sun Heresy (Glorious Dawn Brotherhood, Elversult doctrine)

---

**Role in Narrative:**  
The Yellow Sun Preacher arrived in **Trailsend** claiming that the “God of the Yellow Sun” would soon rise to unite the faithful, shedding old names like Lathander and Amaunator. To the villagers, he was **a miracle-worker**. To Baldric and Flambard, he was a **voice of heresy**, echoing the very rhetoric they had heard in Elversult.

Though unaffiliated by badge or seal, he preaches with the same cadence as **Daelegoth Orndeir**, and his sermons follow the heretical arc that names Lathander as merely a **morning mask** of the ancient solar deity, Amaunator.

---

**Personality and Voice:**  
- Calm, methodical, almost monastic in demeanor  
- Does not rant or convert by force—he invites with parables and lays hands to heal  
- Quotes Elversult's sermons verbatim, despite claiming to never have been there  
- Responds to challenge with gentle deflection

---

**Key Moments with Baldric:**  
- Offers no resistance, only a **counter-question**:  
  > “If one sun casts many shadows, should we not follow the one who remains when dusk comes?”

- Baldric recognizes the doctrine instantly.  
- The preacher agrees to depart—but only if the town's poor will still receive healing.  
- He leaves behind no relic, only the memory of mended bodies and uncertain loyalties.

**Narrative Significance:**  
This preacher is not a rogue element, but a **symptom of something spreading**. His miracles are real. His doctrine is dangerous. And his presence forces Baldric to confront the fact that **heresy no longer wears banners—it walks in plain sight**.
