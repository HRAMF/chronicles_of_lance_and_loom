**Name:** Circle of Leth  
**Region of Origin:** Rawlinswood, Eastern Damara / Western Impiltur

---

**Overview:**  
The Circle of Leth is one of the oldest druidic orders in the Easting Reach, dedicated to the preservation of natural cycles through the observation of stellar alignments, deep-rooted ritual, and the memory of sacred groves. Once revered as wardens of balance in Rawlinswood, the Circle has diminished over time, fractured by mythic corruption and long neglect.

The name *Leth* derives from a lost Netherese word meaning *echo* or *cycle* — reflecting the Circle's deep ties to star-lore, ancestral memory, and seasonal return. Theirs is a patient magic, concerned with memory, renewal, and the safeguarding of ley-threaded sanctuaries.

**Known Members:**
- **Calanthe Forgecrown** – Star-reader, Circle adept, now aligned with Baldric Keenglaive  
- **Tamlorn** – Myth-wounded warden, resisting the spread of corruption within his former Circle  
- **Arannwe** – Elder of the Grove of Hollowed Roots, rescued from mythic near-corruption

**Known Sites of Importance:**
- Grove of Hollowed Roots (current reclamation site)  
- Grove of the Blooming Vow (re-sanctified during campaign)  
- The Mythic Wellspring beneath Dun-Tharos (currently corrupted)

---

**Enemies and Threats:**
- The Rotting Man (perverting ancient rites into corrupted myths)  
- Myth-nodes that mirror and distort Circle teachings  
- Echoes of fallen druids who were overtaken by mythic recursion

---

**Symbolism:**  
- A ring of roots surrounding a constellation  
- Petals falling into mirrored waters  
- The owl and the blooming star

---

**Current Status:**  
Scattered and partially dormant. Survivors are either resisting corruption (like Tamlorn), working to restore sanctified sites (Calanthe), or in recovery (Arannwe). The Circle is poised for rebirth if key groves can be reclaimed and the myths sundered.
