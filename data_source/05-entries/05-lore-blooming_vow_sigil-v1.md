**First Emerged At:** Grove of the Blooming Vow

**Description:**  
The Blooming Vow Sigil is a radiant glyph that spontaneously formed at the moment Baldric and Calanthe renewed their sacred bond amidst mythic corruption. Etched in light across the altar stone of a corrupted grove, it was not carved or cast—but born.  

Its design is striking: **a sunrise entwined with spiral and blooming laurels**. The central dawn radiates outward, wrapped in a living spiral of light and root, framed by a wreath of open laurel leaves. The image balances celestial fire and fertile grace.

**Narrative Significance:**  
The sigil serves as proof that the Blooming Vow is more than personal—it is cosmological. As a synthesis of celestial and natural truth, it marks the first miracle not derived from divine favor alone, but from mortal love affirmed through action. It may become the symbol of a greater movement—one that rewrites myth with memory.
