**Name:** Myth-Broken Seed  
**Origin:** Retrieved from the corrupted myth-node beneath the Coliseum of Unraveling in Dun-Tharos  
**Entrusted To:** Calanthe Forgecrown

---

**Description:**  
A dull, crystal-veined seed roughly the size of a thumb. Its surface is fractured like glass but pulses faintly with inner light. Cold to the touch, it vibrates softly when exposed to mythcraft or consecrated energy.

---

**Properties:**
- **Disruptive Core:** Acts as a nullifying agent when implanted into corrupted myth-nodes or mythic structures
- **Sanctified Essence:** After consecration, resists further corruption and can be used to anchor healing or cleansing rites
- **Druidic Resonance:** Calanthe may use the seed as a focus for dispel magic, remove curse, or related effects targeting myth corruption

---

**Narrative Significance:**  
The Myth-Broken Seed symbolizes the capacity to reject falsehoods imposed by myth. It was recovered in the same moment that Tharolâ€™s false legacy crumbled and handed to Calanthe as a beacon of restoration.
